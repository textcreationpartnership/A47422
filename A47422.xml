            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A <hi>PREFACE</hi> TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout three or four Years ſince, when theſe Oracles of Reaſon appeared in the World, and made ſo great a Noiſe, I were deſired by a Miniſter in the Dioceſs of <hi>Exon,</hi> to read them; and to conceive in Writing, what I thought moſt blama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in them: which Requeſt I complied with; not intending then to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Controverſie in publick; as
<pb facs="tcp:93753:4"/>
all will believe that know the conſtant Avocations of a Parochial Charge.</p>
            <p>Neither did I then doubt, but that a ſet, and formal Anſwer, would long ago have been made to Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Book, but it proves otherwiſe: upon which account I were deſired, upon an accidental Diſcourſe, to publiſh this my Anſwer, which I have now done; not with a deſign to anſwer every thing in the Book, but to anſwer the greateſt, and moſt remarkable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and to obviate the principal Deſign of the Author, in oppoſing revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves in the Dedication of his natural Hiſtory to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> that the Greeks were wont to inſcribe their Books with the Titles of the Muſes, Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, the Horn of <hi>Amatthea, Pandects,</hi> and the like vain Titles, to inſinuate with the Reader. The ſame courſe Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> hath taken, who calls his Book, <hi>The Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Reaſon:</hi> but it is not the Title I am offended with; he ſubver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the Title him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when <hi>p.</hi> 87. he ſays, <hi>That humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is like a Pitcher with two Ears, and that it may be taken on either ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93753:4"/>That which gives Offence, is the Impiety contained in it; as, when <hi>p.</hi> 17. he ſays, <hi>'Tis evident that the Five Books of</hi> Moſes <hi>were written by another Hand after his deceaſe.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 58. <hi>That he can evince from ſacred Oracles, that the fall of Angels was before the Creation of the World.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 89. <hi>That a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator derogates as much from the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, as an Image doth from his Spirituality.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 162. <hi>That they were mean Perſons that call'd our Lord the Son of</hi> David; <hi>and that it was the Mob who cried Hoſanna, when he made his Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade upon an Aſinego.</hi> And many the like Expreſſions, which are to be treated of in their places.</p>
            <p>If he uſes our Lord thus, we of the Clergy can expect no other Treatment from him; to whom he objects ſo much Ignorance, and nick-names us <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>

            <p>I do not deſign to trouble my Reader with a long Ppeface; wherefore I ſhall briefly acquaint him what I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this Book, which I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb facs="tcp:93753:5"/>
into Nine Sections for Methods ſake, and to avoid that Confuſion Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> is guilty of, as his book ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proves.</p>
            <p>The firſt Section is of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and Divine Miracles; where I have manifeſted his Vanity, in appealing to the Teſtimony of the Fathers; and have defended the Divine Miracles from his ſubtile Objections, and ſly Inſinuations. Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> is a true Follower of the Author of the <hi>Preadamites;</hi> who makes uſe of this Method for weakning the Authority of the Scripture; and ſuggeſts his Difficulties without a flat denial, that his Reader may be enſnared unawares. I have alſo ſtated the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Year, a thing of no common Obſervation, and of good Uſe in theſe Controverſies, and proved it to be a perfect ſoler Year.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Section is of Paradiſe; in which I have defended the literal Senſe, and diſcovered his miſtaking the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; and his fathering on <hi>Moſes (p.</hi> 36)
<pb facs="tcp:93753:5"/>
that which he never writ, viz. That four Rivers proceeded from one and the ſame Fountain-head in <hi>Eden:</hi> Where is alſo diſcovered the Falſhood of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and our Deiſts, concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jewiſh and Chriſtian Interpreters of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Section is of the Original of things; in which the difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Creation of Angels is diſcuſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as alſo their Corporiety; which (<hi>p.</hi> 59.) he falſly declares to be the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Catholick Church. We have alſo ſhown, that ſome Particulars are omitted in the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Hiſtory of the Creation, and the Reaſon thereof; from whence Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> can receive no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Laſtly we have ſubjoyned an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Error.</p>
            <p>The fourth Section is of the modern <hi>Brachmins;</hi> in which we ſhow how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult it is to comprehend his Deſign; that his Arguments are of little Force. And his contradiction in ſaying (<hi>p.</hi> 87.) that <hi>Deiſm</hi> is a good manuring of a Man's
<pb facs="tcp:93753:6"/>
Conſcience, if ſorted with Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The fifth Section concerns the <hi>Deiſt</hi>'s Religion. We have made it evident how uncertain this Natural Religion is by the Practice of Nations. And that what he adds of the Imitation of God, deſtroys his own Suppoſition. We have referred the Rewards and Puniſhments of another Life to be conſidered in another Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And whereas he takes it for granted, that the <hi>Deiſt</hi> is no Idolater, we have proved the contrary: and that the ſame reaſon which exempts the <hi>Deiſts</hi> from that imputation, will exempt <hi>Romaniſts, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, Socinian, Mahometan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Section concerns the <hi>Arians, Trinitarians,</hi> and <hi>Councils.</hi> In th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it will appear how perverſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Affairs of thoſe times. <hi>P.</hi> 98. He makes the <hi>Arians</hi> to be Mounters of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to the Throne; although if they had then a being, yet they made no Figure in the World. He fully tells us, that the <hi>Arians</hi> appealed for tryal
<pb facs="tcp:93753:6"/>
to the Fathers; that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at <hi>Nice</hi> by a Party, and by the Artifice of the Emperor. Where he alſo gives us a monſtrous Account of the Number of the Biſhops there aſſembled. And <hi>p.</hi> 99. he affirms, that the <hi>Arians</hi> had not Freedome to diſpute their Cauſe. He repreſents the <hi>Arian</hi> Councils of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riminum</hi> very Erroneouſly, He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts his Malignity when he accuſes the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> of Ignorance; and for Proof, cites a Canon of the Church; and <hi>p.</hi> 103. he gives many Inſtances of the ſame: where we have proved that there is no ſuch Canon, as far as a Negative is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being proved. And we have diſcovered his diſingenuity in not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Du Ranckin,</hi> from whom he borrowed all his Materials; word for word.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Section, is of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoul, and of the Original of the <hi>Jews.</hi> In this Section, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of revealed Religion is proved from the inſufficiency of Philoſophical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to this purpoſe. As alſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb facs="tcp:93753:7"/>
to a future State. Which, as Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> confeſſes, <hi>p.</hi> 118. hath ſo much ruffled and entangled mens Minds. The principal philoſophic Reaſon is exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and refell'd: From whence it will be evident, that the Scriptures alone give a ſatisfactory Account of thoſe things.

            <p>From his account of <hi>Augury,</hi> I have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Neceſſity of revealed Religion; diſcovered his miſtake of Chriſtian Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. If what <hi>Varenius,</hi> concerning whole Nations being Atheiſtical, affirms, be true, the moſt learned Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> ſeems to
<pb facs="tcp:93753:8"/>
be under ſome miſtake. <hi>Varenius,</hi> his Aſſertion argues the Neceſſity of revealed Religion; the <hi>Chinenſian</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of time, proved to be vain and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; as alſo, the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> the main Props of our Author's Hypotheſis; the Origine of Good and Evil not to be known by natural Religion. If Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be granted, concerning the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Deiſt</hi> muſt be an Idolater: his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for plurality of worlds refuted: the principal Arguments of <hi>Ocellus Lucanus</hi> refell'd, his Age examined; with ſome uncommon Obſervations relating to him; and our Author's great Vanity, in making him cotemporary with, or ancienter then <hi>Moſes,</hi> expoſed. <hi>Mr. Blount</hi>'s great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a double Creation, out of the firſt and ſecond Chapters of <hi>Geneſis</hi> enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, and proved ineffectual. From hence we may ſee the reaſon, why in his 5th Page, he propounds it as a Difficulty, how diſtinct pieces of the World ſhould be Peopled, as <hi>America,</hi> and the like, without a miracle; and of <hi>Mathuſalem</hi>'s being the longeſt llv'd of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in his Hypotheſis of two diſtinct O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals

of mankind, they have an eaſie Solution; although they have a truer, and a much eaſier one in ours. This method of his, is indeed allowable in Philoſophy, which varies according to every new <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi> but hath no place in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>His Diſingenuity, in relation to <hi>Cicero,</hi> reproved; the Difference between <hi>Ocellus</hi> and the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> is obſerved.</p>
            <p>There are many other Matters contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Book, which for Brevities ſake I have omited, but are perſpicuouſly treated of, and I hope, to the Readers ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Two things remain, which I think fit to acquaint my Reader with: one is, that theſe Oracles are many of them tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of modern Authors, of whom I have taken no Notice, but require all at Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Hands, he being the Perſon that gave them the Title of Oracles: neither take I any Notice of others concerned, he being the chief Architect.</p>
            <p>The other is, that theſe Controverſies depending much on Authority, I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to make frequent appeals to
<pb facs="tcp:93753:9"/>
               <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors; whom, for the Benefit of ſome Readers, I have tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> where, if I have not kept my ſelf ſtrictly to the Words, yet I have taken all care not to deviate from tne true ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As in all Duty bound, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit the cenſure of what I have written, to my Superiors in the Cnurch of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <q>That many Fathers of the Church have conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the whole <hi>Moſaic</hi> Creation ſeems to have been but a pious Allegory.</q>

                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93753:10"/>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>It is worth obſerving, that although the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of theſe pretended Oracles of Reaſon hath little regard for the Holy Scriptures; and without all peradventure, leſs for the Fathers of the Church: yet upon all Occaſions he makes uſe of their Authorities, and frequently quotes them.</p>
                  <p>Upon reading this Imputation, and his faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch a Charge upon many Fathers of the Church, I forthwith conſulted Mr. <hi>Dally</hi> of the Uſe of the Fathers, Book the ſecond, Chapter three and fourth; where he treats profeſſedly of the Fathers Errors; and I find nothing there that favours this bold Aſſertion. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I find an Expreſſion of <hi>Dally</hi>'s from the unanimous Conſent of the Fathers; which if it be true, this of the Oracle muſt neceſſarily be falſe.</p>
                  <p>None of the ancient Fathers can be charged with this Miſtake; if <hi>Origen</hi> (his Interpreters I take not into the Number) and perhaps St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> be excepted.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Chap. 2. of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſpeaks not of above One that was of this Opinion; and the Margent refers us to <hi>Origen.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had it been true what theſe Oracles ſuggeſts <hi>p.</hi> 49. That in the firſt Ages of the Chriſtian Church, the more candid Interpreters deviated from the literal reading of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93753:10"/>
St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> could not have been ſuppoſed to have paſſed it over in ſilence.</p>
                  <p>But whatever the Sentiments of theſe two Fathers were; this is certain, that the allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing Method, and the cabbaliſtick Strain, ſo much uſed by <hi>Origen,</hi> was condemned in the fifth General Council; as <hi>Photius</hi> informs us in his Epiſtle to <hi>Michael</hi> Prince of <hi>Bulgaria.</hi> The fifth General Council <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, condemned and anathematiſed <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen;</hi> and that for this reaſon, becauſe this his allegorizing Method would introduce into the Church Pagan Fables and Greek Muthology. And thus we ſee how Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s many Fathers are dwindled into Two. The Principle cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Univerſal Church; and St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath ſo compiled his Hexameron, that he ſeems rather to have followed the Opinion of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytus</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> then that of <hi>Origen.</hi>

                        <hi>There are great Errors in reading the Scriptures, in relation to Divine Miracles; as the Darkneſs at the death of our Saviour; which ſome ſay, was ſpread over the Face of the whole Earth: Others, and ſome able In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, have only Tranſlated it, upon all the Land of the</hi> Jews, <hi>viz.</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>which the</hi> Hebrews <hi>always meant, when they ſaid the Earth.</hi>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>That Errors may be committed in reading the Scriptures, is a thing too notorious. But ſeeing our Author's Deſign is to diſparage Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, (<hi>Quid verba quaero cum facta video,</hi> I may ſay with the Comedian); and by telling the World there are Stories in it, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Fables of the Poets, and ſound like <hi>Garagantua</hi> and <hi>Bevis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He plainly inſinuates, that little Regard is to be had to Scripture-Miracles. I ſhall lay down what is ſufficient for aſſerting the moſt remarkable Inſtances that he mentions; that the Darkneſs at the Death of our Saviour was over the Face of the whole Earth, (with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Univerſality of the Globe) cannot be proved from the Original, nor from our laſt Tranſlators of the Bible; who render it, Darkneſs was over all the Land; that is, <hi>Judea.</hi> So Dr. <hi>Hakewill</hi> in his Apology, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 218.</p>

reading the Scripture, Artificially endeavours the ſubverting the Veracity of the Miracle.</p>
                  <p>There is one Difficulty yet behind, and that is, Whether this Darkneſs was occaſioned by an Eclipſe of the Sun, or by the Interpoſition of Clouds, or by the ſhrinking in of the Sun Beams, like the Darkneſs of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Of this Opinion, were <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Hierom, Chryſoſtom, Theaphylact, Enthymius,</hi> and <hi>Julius Africanus,</hi> who reproves <hi>Thallus</hi> for calling it an Eclipſe, as being an unadviſed Speech, and indeed it was ſo; for one Miracle would ſuffice for the Darkneſs; but a total Eclipſe, and that for the ſpace of Three Hours, at the full Moon (for it was at the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover) would include many great Miracles.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore for the better underſtanding of this Miracle, we will briefly mention what we have met with in good Hiſtory, concerning the Suns Darkneſs, and obſerve what was peculiar in that, at our Lords Death.</p>

                  <p>What kind of Dial King <hi>Ahaz</hi> His Dial was is not yet agreed on by the Learned in that Science. <hi>Gafferell</hi> in his unheard of Curioſities <hi>P.</hi> 280. hath theſe words, <hi>As for the Figure of it, there is no Man hitherto, that hath Publiſhed what it was.</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93753:19"/>
may be done on a Dial made without the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks. In our Elevation here in <hi>Exeter,</hi> a Plane may be fitted for ſuch a Poler Altitude, as will make a Retroceſſion of the Shadow Natural. I Remember a good Mathematician told me, that he made a <hi>South</hi> Vertical Dial, for the Right Honourable the late Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> of <hi>Chudleigh</hi> in <hi>Devon;</hi> on which this <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of the Shadows going back might be ſeen: the Degrees mentioned in this Miracle, are primarily to be underſtood of thoſe in Heaven, for they are the Degrees moſt properly ſo called; therefore the Sun with the <hi>Primum-Mobile,</hi> and the <hi>Caeleſtial Sphears,</hi> went ſo far backward in their Diurnal Motion, as made up the ſpace of Ten Degrees in the Equinoctial Line, which anſwered to Two Third parts of an Hour on the Dial of <hi>Ahaz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Difficulties which are ſuggeſted, are grounded on great Miſtakes; as if Equinoctial Degrees and Signs of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> were the ſame thing; and that the Retroceſſion of the Sun, Ten Degrees in the Polar Altitude of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould bring back with Him Ten Months, or Ten Signs of the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> an Error inexcuſable in the meaneſt Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>Of the like nature is that other, From the Miracles being viſible only in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and not at <hi>Babilon.</hi> For the Acuteneſs of this Arch of Ten Degrees was ſuch, with relation even to thoſe in <hi>Judaea;</hi> that it could not be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93753:19"/>
perceived there, unleſs <hi>Geometrically</hi> obſerved by a Quadrant or Aſtrolabe. And I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is no Aſtronomer but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that altho the Miracle conſiſted in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of the Sun; yet it was more apparent, by the going back of the Shadow on the Dial. So that, had there not been a going back of the Shadow, the Miracle might have been loſt, and no Man might have obſerved it. The Arch of the Ten Degrees in the Suns going back, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I have ſaid) ſo Acute, as that it was not to be perceived, but by the help of ſuch Inſtruments, which the <hi>Jews</hi> (as far as I have Read) never had.</p>

When the Famine is ſaid to prevail over the whole Earth, Divines underſtand it of ſome part of the Earth; What ſhould hinder, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93753:21"/>
that the ſame may be underſtood in this caſe of the Flood, and the deſtruction of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
                  <p>This is moſt certain from the Holy Scriptures. That all Mankind <hi>(thoſe in the Ark excepted)</hi> were deſtroyed by the Flood. For the occaſion thereof is thus expreſſed in <hi>Geneſis. And God ſaw the wickedneſs of Man was great upon the Earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually: and the Lord ſaid I will deſtroy Man whom I have created from the face of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And (again) <hi>all Fleſh died thot moved upon the Face of the Earth; and every Man, and every living Subſtance was deſtroyed that was upon the Face of the Ground, both Man and Cattle; and the Creeping things, and the Fowl of Heaven, and they were deſtroyed from the Earth, and</hi> Noah <hi>only remained alive, and they that were with Him in the Ark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> is very vain, in Muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Arguments he pretends to be brought to prove, that the Flood was only in the Land of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſeems to be in a great Error, in limiting the ſame to <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> For as it ſeems ſtrange, that in ſo ſhort an Interval as that was from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Flood; according to the ordinary Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation 1656 Years, and not much above Two thouſand according to the largeſt, the World ſhould then be fully Peopled: So it alſo ſeems no leſs ſtrange, that in ſuch a ſpace of time
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93753:21"/>
                     <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> ſhould only be Peopled. Beſides, it cannot be well imagined, that ſo many Nations ſhould have knowledg thereof, if it were not of a much greater extent; For <hi>Voſſius</hi> confeſſeth that almoſt all Nations had knowledg thereof, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Joſephus a Coſta</hi> Witneſſeth for the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Laet.

                  <p>And now we draw towards a Concluſion, I ſhall not uſe any other Words, then thoſe which are uſed by the moſt Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> (now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>) in his <hi>Origines Sacrae, p.</hi> 539 and 540.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I cannot ſee any urgent neceſſity from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert, that the Flood did ſpread it ſelf over all the ſurface of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is evident that the Flood was <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal as to Mankind, but from thence follows no neceſſity at all, of aſſerting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſallity of it, as to the Globe of the Earth, unleſs it be ſufficiently proved; that the whole Earth was Peopled before the Flood: which I diſpair of ever ſeeing proved.</hi>

                  <p>That Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> hath not Faith to waſh down Original Sin, which ſticks in his Throat, is a thing to be lamented; this truth being ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down in Holy Writ, that no Man (who hath any regard for the Scriptures) but will be offended with him, for Writing ſo contempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The chief Argument which he brings for his opinion, taken from Penance and Repentance is of no force But becauſe I think tis new, I will conſider it.</p>
                  <p>In the Primitive Church Penance was only impoſed for Three Crimes, <hi>viz.</hi> Idolatry, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide, and Adultry; which is proved at large by <hi>Morinus</hi> in his fifth Book <hi>de Penitentia, cap.</hi> 3. out of <hi>Fathers and Councils;</hi> and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Chapter thu — <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Truſting to ſo many Teſtimonies, we think we may truly conclude, that for almoſt Four Hundred Years after our Saviour, no Penance was Impoſed, but only for theſe Three Crimes.</p>
                  <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Negative Argument, with relation to the Practice of the Church be valid; how many Men have lived in the World without Actual Sin? So that his Argument proves too much, a moſt certain ſign of its Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>As for the Second part of his Argument; <hi>That no Church ever required Repentance for Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin,</hi> is a miſtake, and proceeds from not knowing the Churches Practice.</p>
                  <p>In the Primitive Church, Repentance was required of all adult Perſons, who deſired Baptiſm; which muſt relate to Original as well as Actual Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>de Baptiſmo,</hi> ſays, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſuras Baptiſmum, orationibus crebris, jejuniis, &amp; geniculationibus crebris &amp; pervigiliis orare apor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, &amp; confeſſione omnium retro delectorum.</hi> Such as intend to be Baptized, muſt prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by frequent Prayers, Faſtings, frequent Humiliations, Watchings, with Confeſſion of all their Sins.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable to this ancient Practice; our Church begins its Office of Baptiſm with the Confeſſion of Original Sin; in theſe Words, <hi>Dearly beloved, for as much as all Men are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93753:23"/>
and born in Sin</hi>— and our Church prays for the Pardon of the ſame in theſe Words, <hi>We call upon thee for theſe Infants, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Holy Baptiſm, may receive Remiſſion of their Sins by ſpiritual Regeneration:</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe, before <hi>Tertullian,</hi> we have <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in his ſecond Apology, where he ſays, <hi>That thoſe who were to be Baptiſed;</hi> jejunare do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centur, nobis una, cum illis, &amp; orantibus, &amp; jejunantibus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. They are required to Faſt, the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation alſo praying and faſting together with them.</p>
                  <p>Now the Church requiring all Catechumens to renounce all Sin, the Devil, and all his Works, to confeſs all their Sins, to faſt and pray for God's Pardon, in order thereunto; What is this but Repentance, as well with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Original, as Actual, Sins? Beſides, he promiſes amendment in this particular, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be lead by his corrupt Affections.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable hereunto, is that in the Larger Creed in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s <hi>Ancorate,</hi> where Baptiſm is call'd Baptiſm of Repentance, and in the Creed of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, I believe one Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi>

                  <p>I know not any thing juſtly to be cenſured in the Opinions of thoſe Divines; thoſe are to be blamed that miſunderſtand and miſapply what they have truly written.

                  </p>
                  <p>There is no Book in the World, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor can be more plainly demonſtrated, than that of the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> it can be made appear out of the Holy Scriptures; for which, if Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> had any Reverence, he could never have fallen into ſo great an Error. It can be made appear from the Conſent of all Nations, and all Authors (except ſome Modern ones) who make any mention of the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> whether Jews, or Chriſtians, or Gentiles, they all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it as a certain Truth, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Author thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:93753:24"/>Our Saviour, in the fifth Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> Ver. 46, and 47, ſays, <q>Had ye believed <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me — But if ye believe not his Writings how ſhall ye believe my Words.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> writ, and he writ thoſe Books, which the Jews read as writ by him; and no Man can deny, but thoſe Books are the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> 'Tis certain that Chriſt always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed the Prophets from the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and by the Law underſtood the <hi>Pentateuch. Philip</hi> ſaid to <hi>Nathaniel, John</hi> 1. <hi>We have found him, of whom</hi> Moſes <hi>writ in the Law, of whom the Prophets have ſpoken,</hi> Luke 24. Ver. 27. <hi>And beginning at</hi> Moſes <hi>and all the Prophets, he expounded to them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelf.</hi> And in the 15th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>of old time hath in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of which it appears without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, that <hi>Moſes</hi> writ the Law,; by which Word, <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſay, the whole <hi>Pentateuch</hi> is meant. And that the Modern Jews underſtand the Word <hi>Law,</hi> in the ſame manner, we have the Authority of <hi>Leo Modena,</hi> a Rabbi of <hi>Venice,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Iews throughout the World, in which Book, <hi>p.</hi> 247. he hath theſe Words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93753:25"/>
                     <q>We ſhall here in the laſt place, glve the Reader a View of the Thirteen Articles of their Belief, as it is delivered by <hi>Rabbi, Moſes Egyptus,</hi> in his Expoſition upon the <hi>Miſcna</hi> in <hi>Sanedim, cap. Helech;</hi> which Articles are generally believed by all Jews without contra: diction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Seventh Article of their Faith is, That <hi>Moſes</hi> was the greateſt Prophet that ever hath been; and that he was endued with a different and higher Degree of Prophecy, than any other.</p>
                  <p>The Eighth is, That the Law which was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> was wholly dictated by God; and that <hi>Moſes</hi> put not one Syllable in of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>What this Law is, appears out of the firſt Page of that Hiſtory, among the Rites which are obſerved by all the Jews, and he ſays, are the Precepts of the <hi>Written Law:</hi> Namely, ſuch as are contained in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which are in all, Six hundred and thirteen in Number; that is to ſay, Two hundred forty eight affirmative, and Three hundred ſixty five negative. And theſe they call <hi>Mizuoth de Oraita;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Precepts of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence we may conclude without all manner of doubt, that by the Word <hi>Law,</hi> (in our Saviour's Speech, and in thoſe other places of Scripture which I have cited) the whole <hi>Pentateuch</hi> is underſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93753:25"/>The Teſtimony which is brought from the Conſent of all Nations, is ſo fully explicated and declared by <hi>Huetius,</hi> that none can doubt of the Truth thereof; and to whom I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refer my Reader, then here to tranſcribe him. Eſpecially, conſidering I have ſo fully proved the ſame from the Holy Scriptures, and Indiſputable Authority.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add two or three Obſervations hereunto belonging, and conclude this Point.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Obſervation is, that neither <hi>Julian</hi> nor <hi>Porphiry,</hi> nor any of the moſt inveterate Enemies of the Chriſtian or Jewiſh Faith, did ever make it a Queſtion, whether <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> The firſt that ever ſtarted thoſe Objections againſt it, and are now ſo much valued, was one <hi>Abenezra</hi> a Jew; who, although he did not dare to be ſo bold fac'd, as to deny openly ſo important a Truth: yet, by the Difficulties he propoſed, and by the manner of his propoſing them, (as Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> doth his Oracles) he plainly enough inſinuates to an intelligent Reader, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was no other, than to overthrow the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> out of his Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe it is, that <hi>Hobbs, Spinoſa,</hi> and other ſuch Politicians in Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Learning, have furniſhed themſelves with Objections, ſuch as they are, and which have been often anſwered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:93753:26"/>My Second Obſervation is, That not only <hi>Philo Judaeus, Joſephus,</hi> and all others, as well Ancient and Modern Jews, did underſtand by the Law, the whole <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> but alſo the Gentiles did underſtand it in the ſame manner: and conſequently it cannot be imagined, that the Law mentioned by our Lord ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a different Senſe.</p>
                  <p>The Author I ſhall cite for Proof hereof, is <hi>Dionyſius Longinus,</hi> in his Book, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Sect 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>So the Legiſlator of the Jews, no common Perſon, when he declares and makes known the Power of his God, according to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, preſently in the beginning of his Laws, he tells us, that God ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light, and it was ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Longinus</hi> in this place, calls the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the beginning of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws. And if <hi>Geneſis</hi> comes under that Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I think no queſtion can be made of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books, nor of the true Senſe of thoſe places by me brought out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>My Laſt Obſervation is, That one of the great Proofs of revealed Religion depends on the Antiquity and Verity of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, if theſe Books were not written by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> a wide Gate would be opened for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93753:26"/>
and Deiſts to redicule them, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them for Fables. Preadamitiſm and the Eternity of the World, might be received as uncontroulable Doctrines; and Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion deprived of the Support of thoſe Writings, to which our Lord was pleaſed to make an Appeal.</p>
                  <p>So that is is no wonder that Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> ſhould be ſo poſitive, and endeavour with ſuch Confidence to ſubvert theſe Writings, by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, That it is evident that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of them. He well knowing, that his pretended Oracles of Reaſon will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Scandalous and Falſe, as long as this part of Holy Scriptures, the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Writings, can be defended.</p>

                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93753:28"/>Our Author often cites the Canons of the Church when they ſerve his Turn. Here he mentions none; and I am certain there is good Reaſon for it: for not to mention ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which he muſt neceſſarily know, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns this Practice. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> condemns it, and in Seſſion 4th. condemns them who ſhall convert and wreſt the Words of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, to Prophaneneſs, Scurrilouſneſs, Fabulouſneſs, Flatteries, Diſtractions, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, or too ſcurrilous Libels.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Council of <hi>Millain</hi> declares, That their Raſhneſs is very wicked, who abſue the Words or Sentences of Holy Scripture, to Flattery, Contumely, Superſtition, Impiety, or to any prophane Purpoſes; and that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are to puniſh ſuch Offenders according to the holy Canons.</p>
                  <p>So that as far as I know, this folly of our Author in ſporting thus with Holy Scripture, is condemned by all Chriſtians, of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Denomination in the whole World.</p>

                  <p>That there may be a plain and a full Solution of the difficulties, the Oracle propoſes both in this Paragaph, and in the other, which ſhall be examined in this Section.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall premiſe a Conſideration or Two, of good uſe in the Matters under Debate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt Conſideration</hi> ſhall be of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as to this Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> ſhall be of the great alterations that have happened to many places of the Earth ſince the Creation: Out of which it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that many places then well known, may now be wholy unknown to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall make a brief Reply to what the Oracle hath here declared.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt Conſideration</hi> relating to the Ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> is that they always looked on the Book <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as a Book hard to be underſtood; yet to contain a literal Senſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93753:29"/>St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Commentaries on Ezechiel,</hi> ſays, <hi>Niſi quis apud eos aetatem Sacerdotalis Miniſterii; id eſt, triceſimum annum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plever it, principium Geneſeos legere non permittitur.</hi> Unleſs a Man had attained to the Year of the Sacerdotal Miniſtry, which is the Thirtieth Year compleat, they were not permitted to Read the beginning of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> Which Practice appears alſo out of the <hi>Prologue Galeat,</hi> and from <hi>Origen</hi> on the <hi>Canticles:</hi> we are told by both, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors forbid theſe Four things (becauſe of their Difficulty and Profoundneſs) to be read by any, but ſuch as attained to Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years of Age; and thoſe were, the Three Firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the beginning and end of the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and the Book of <hi>Canticles:</hi> This Decree of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors is alſo mentioned by <hi>Proſper Aquitanicus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Vita Contemplativa, c.</hi> 6. Where he gives us a good Account thereof; and contends for the literal Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Now altho they account this Book obſcure; yet I do not find, that any of the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> excluded a literal Senſe, <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> excepted, whoſe Arguments are very weak, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo great an Author.</p>
                  <p>It was a known rule among the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> that Scripture falls not in with the Midraſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Scriptures are to be Interpreted in a literal Senſe. And <hi>Buxtorf de punct. Antique.</hi> tells us, That when the Allegorical or Cabaliſtick Senſe is contrary to the Literal, the Cabaliſtick is to

be rejected; neither muſt we think otherwiſe of the Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> if they will be conſentaneous to themſelves, and the Eighth Article of their Creed.</p>
                  <p>Out of which it neceſſarily follows, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho the <hi>Jews</hi> allowed an Allegorical Senſe, yet they never allowed any which interfered with the Literal.</p>

                  <p>Some think that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> contradicts himſelf, for as much as he writes in the Book <hi>De Cardinalibus Chriſti operibus</hi> (which goes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Name) <hi>ante hoc temporale initium ipſe in principio, imo ipſe principium exiſtens apud Deum ante hominis conditionem ſuperbientis Diaboli rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam videt &amp; affectatae dominationis ambitionem.</hi> Where writing concerning our Lord, he ſays, <hi>Before the Beginning of this World he was in the Beginning; nay, he was the Beginning himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God before Man was created; he ſaw the ruine of the Devil, and of the Domination he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſt that this place comes home, and is to the purpoſe. But then it muſt be confeſt, that not St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but <hi>Arnaldus,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Bonae Vallis,</hi> was Author of thoſe Books.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine de Scriptoribus Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> proves St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> could not be the Author of that Book; becauſe he affirms, <hi>Diabolum cecidiſſe de coelo ante hominis creationem, cujus ſententiae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarium habet Cyprianus in Tractatu de Zelo &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vore.</hi> That the Devil fell from Heaven before Man was created; whereas St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

the contrary in his Book, <hi>De Zelo &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Obſervation of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is allowed of by <hi>Dalle</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Libris ſuppoſitis Dionyſio &amp; Ignatio, p.</hi> 468.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Thomas James,</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Corruption of Fathers, informs us, That in an ancient Manuſcript in <hi>All Souls</hi> Library, the Author of this Book is of much later Date, written by one that lived in St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s time, to whom he wrote one or two Epiſtles, and that he was called <hi>Arnoldus Bonae villacenſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We learn alſo from the foreſaid Manuſcript, that the Book was Dedicated not unto <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the Pope, who lived Anno. 254. but unto <hi>Adrian</hi> the Pope, the Fourth of that Name, who was created Pope Anno. 1154. and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Third, to whom <hi>Bernard</hi> wrote his Books of Conſideration. And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hereunto is Mr. <hi>Dalle,</hi> who in his Book before cited acquaints us, that the ſame is to be found in a Manuſcript in the French King's Library.</p>
                  <p>So that Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Authority from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is reduced only to One that delivers his Mind plainly, and he a very late one too, who lived ſome hundreds of Years after St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Simeon Dunelmenſis</hi> an Ancient and good <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Hiſtorian, in his Book <hi>de Geſtis regum Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum ad annum</hi> 792 ſays, <hi>That</hi> Charles <hi>King of</hi> France <hi>ſeut a Synodal Book into</hi> Britain <hi>which he received from</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>in which Book were contained the Decrees of the Second</hi> Nicene <hi>Council.</hi> Now, how our Church in thoſe days was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or rather diſpleaſed therewith, the fame <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelmenſis</hi> tells us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In quo Libro, hu, proh Dolor! Multa inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientia, &amp; verae fidei contraria reperiunt, maxime quod ibidem confirmatum imagines adorare debere, quod omnino Eccleſia Dei execratur.</hi> In which Book, alas! Many inconvenient things were found, and repugnant to the true Faith; eſpecially that which relates to the Worſhip of Images, which the Church of God doth utterly abominate. This Teſtimony is the more to be regarded, for that it appears from hence, that in thoſe days our Church abhorred Image Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>This Teſtimony is Recorded alſo by <hi>Roger Hoveden, Matthew Weſtminſter,</hi> and other our Ancient and beſt Hiſtorians: And ſo much confounded the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in the begining of the Reformation, that their great Advocate <hi>Harpſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> could make no other Reply, but that it was <hi>commentitia &amp; inſulſa fabula,</hi> a fooliſh, and an
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93753:38"/>
invented Fable, and that it was not Written by <hi>Simeon Dunelmenſis</hi> or <hi>Matthew Weſtminſter</hi> (He makes no mention of <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> nor of the Manuſcript Hiſtory of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Bibliothec) whereas the ſame is now to be found in the Manuſcript of <hi>Dunelmenſis</hi> in <hi>Bennet</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg Library in <hi>Cambridge:</hi> And thoſe who have been converſant in thoſe things, aſſure us that the ſame is to be ſeen in divers Manuſcripts of <hi>Mathew Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Hoveden,</hi> and that all old and uncorrupted Copies teſtifie the ſame thing. Of what Quallity <hi>Dunelmenſis</hi> was, I need not ſay much, ſince the Preface to the <hi>Decem Scriptures,</hi> is very full to this purpoſe; I ſhall only here ſay, that he is accounted one of our beſt Hiſtorians, by the Pontifician and Reformed Parties. He was Chantour of the Church of Saint <hi>Cuthberts</hi> in <hi>Durham,</hi> and continued his Hiſtory to the Days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt.</p>
                  <p>But, Suppoſing that this Synod was Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, (or that which is all one) that the Opinion of the <hi>Catholick-Church</hi> might be gathered from it, as touching the Corporiety of Angels and Souls, Doth it appear that ſuch was the definition of that <hi>Synod</hi> in any of its Decrees? Or, doth it appear that they Confirmed the Opinion of <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> in this Point? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, nothing leſs.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, in Reading Councils, little regard is to be had to what a private Doctor or Biſhop may declare or ſay, we ought only to look to the Decree or Definition of the Synod. And this (ſays <hi>Richer</hi>) I have Obſerved in another Place.</p>
                  <p>And now I may, without doing any wrong, Conclude; that Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> hath Read the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils very negligently, and makes uſe of them at Second Hand.

                  <p>Yet it muſt be granted.

Then I beheld all the work of God, that a Man cannot find out the work that is done under the Sun: becauſe though a man labour to ſeek it out, yea further, tho' a wiſe man think to know it, yet ſhall he not be able to find it.</q> 
                     <hi>Maimonides</hi> (who was in great Reputation among the <hi>Jews</hi>) determines the Queſtion thus, <hi>Omnia ſimul creata aberant, &amp; poſtea ſucceſſive invicem ſeparata;</hi> all things were created at once, and afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeparate Claſſes and Times.</p>
                  <p>However it be, 'tis certain St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had a firm Veneration for the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Hiſtory; he never ridiculed it, as our Author does; and if he miſtook in the Interpretation of a place of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he may be excuſed, who ſubmitted himſelf to the Rule of Faith, and conſtantly believed that the World had a Beginning.</p>
                  <p>And although our Author in this place thinks St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> came not wide of the Mark, yet I ſuppoſe he will not thank him for what he ſays in his 43d Chaprer of Hereſies, where he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the Origeniſts for Hereticks, for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting Paradiſe Allegorically, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Letter.</p>

                  <p>Of theſe ſeveral Worlds exiſting at one time in divers Regions of the Univerſe, I find no mention, either in that Book under the Name of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> nor in <hi>Porphury,</hi> nor in <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Account we have in <hi>Quintus Curtius, lib.</hi> 8. is, That they approved of Self-murther, they worſhipped many Gods, and eſpecially Trees for Gods. The Remark of <hi>Curtius</hi> is worth Notice, <hi>Quis credat inter haec vitia eſſe curam ſapientiae?</hi> Who can think where there were ſuch Vices, any regard could be had for Philoſophy?</p>
                  <p>What Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> could deſign by this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot by me be comprehended; his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments have little ſtrength; and ſuppoſing they were convincing, yet nothing could from thence be collected worthy of Obſervation.</p>

                  <p>What he writes of human Reaſon, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it to a Pitcher with two Ears, may be allowed, and gives us ſome Light how to behold his Oracles as we ought; for moſt of them have two Handles, and are propoſed (as the Devils Oracles were of Old) full of Ambiguity; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picterus</hi> in his <hi>Enchiridion, c.</hi> 65. ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

The whole Syſtem of Chriſtian Religion requires our Belief thereof: and therefore, as we have ſaid in the end of the foregoing Section, the <hi>Deiſt</hi> is repugnant to Himſelf, when He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſome advantage from Chriſtianity; and yet wholly rejects the grand <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> upon which it is built.</p>

                  <p>That great <hi>Deiſt</hi> Pliny, begins his Natural Hiſtory in theſe words, <hi>Mundum numen eſſe credi par eſt, aeternum, immen ſum, neque genitum, neque interiturum unquam;</hi> 
                     <q>It is fit to be believed that the World is God, eternal, immenſe, having neither beginning, nor end.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is the opinion of our Modern <hi>Deiſts,</hi> theſe Oracles of Reaſon prove: for in the Title Page of the Book we find it laid down as the the 16th. Oracle, <hi>That the World is eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that 'tis eaſy to be perceived, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded this Vaunting of our <hi>Deiſt</hi> is: and that He will find it more difficult to purge Himſelf of Idolatry, than to faſten it on others.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>More</hi> indeed in his Apologetical Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle for the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſophy, (<hi>p.</hi> 4.) perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily aſſerts, That there were always, and even now, that there are ſome, who ſeriouſly conjoyn this Opinion of the Independency and Eternity of Matter, with the Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: But then the Dr. adds, <q>That this is inconſiſtent with the true Notion of God: and in truth it is in Scripture language, halting between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> which include <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>

                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:93753:46"/>That the Infinity of the World introduces a Duality of God, is rightly inferr'd by the great <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 359. <hi>Exerc. cont. Cardanum—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiti menſura nulla eſt; duo infinita nequeunt eſſe; neque in natura, neque extra naturam, eſſent enim duo principia prima:</hi> 
                     <q>An Infinite cannot be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, wherefore there cannot be two Infinites; Equality is the formal Reaſon of Commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</q> And yet the <hi>Deiſt</hi> makes both God and the World Infinite.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Deiſt</hi> acknowledges here in words, That there is one Supreme <hi>God;</hi> yet He cannot ſay this upon any firm Principle, becauſe (<hi>p.</hi> 192.) He ſays, <q>If <hi>Geneſis</hi> be but a Parable, the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> may be in the right, as well as the <hi>Jews;</hi>
                     </q> Which is in effect to ſay, That they who believe and worſhip two contrary Gods, with two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Services, as the <hi>Perſians</hi> did, according to the appointment of their <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> (who was 5000 Years ancienter than the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, if you will believe their fabulous Chronology) may be as much in the right as thoſe, who believe one only God. To ſuch Repugnances Men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, who defend untruths: and to thoſe may be apply'd that of the Apoſtle (in the 2 Ep. <hi>Theſ.</hi> c. 2. ver. 11.) <hi>And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie.</hi>

Truly ye cannot bring ſo much as one of the number of thoſe who were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prudent and Wiſe, all ſuch deteſt you.

In an Epiſtle of his to <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (as we find it in <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Book the firſt, Chapter fourth) ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>You <hi>Arians</hi> have ſo good Opinion of your ſelves, as that you think none of the Ancients are worthy to be compared to you. Neither will ye endure, that thoſe who in my younger Days were eſteemed as our Guides and Maſters, ſhould upon any Terms be equalled to you. Neither will ye grant that any of our preſent Colleagues have any competent Knowledge of theſe Controverſies. Ye think your ſelves to be the only wiſe Men; and that although ye have nothing, yet ye enjoy all things. You boaſt, that you alone are the finders out and poſſeſſors of Truth; and that to you ſuch Myſteries are revealed, and kept from other Men.</p>
                  <p>By which Words <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſignifies, that the <hi>Arian</hi> Sentiments were repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Doctrine of the moſt ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the Doctrine of his immediate Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and of all thoſe Biſhops who had the

Government of the Church, when this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy began. He ſignifies alſo, that the firſt Defenders of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> were Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts, and pretenders to extraordinary Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>To theſe two, I will only add St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who treating of the bleſſed Trinity at large in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Books, in his firſt Book, Chapter the 3d. he delivers his Mind as fully, and as much to the purpoſe, as either of the two before quoted: Thus he ſays, <hi>Omnes quos legere potui qui ante me ſcripſerunt de Trinitate, divinorum librorum veto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; novorum Catholici tractatores, hoc intende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt ſecundum Scripturas docere, quod pater &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius &amp; ſpiritus ſanctus unius ejuſdemque ſubſtantiae inſeparabili aequalitate divinam inſinuent unitatem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Authors that I have met with, who have written before me of the holy Trinity; all the Orthodox Writers and Commentators of the Divine Books of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament propoſed this to themſelves, to prove, that according to the Holy Scriptures, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, have one and the ſame Subſtance, which includes a Divine Unity with an inſeparable Equality.</p>
                  <p>This laſt Teſtimony of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and as comprehenſive as the moſt zealous <hi>Trinitarian</hi> could deſire.

yet by affirming, either by miſtake or deſign, that this heavenly Doctrine cannot be proved by Scripture, nor by the Fathers that preceded the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, but only by unwritten Tradition they have given great advantage to the <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> to triumph, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them in their Heterodox Opinion, <hi>nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe hoc vult Ithacus, magno &amp; mercantur Achivi.</hi>

                  <p>For the ſatisfaction of ſuch, I make this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That I believe Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> had no Grounds, but ſuch only as we find cited in <hi>Sandius</hi> and <hi>Selden.</hi> In the firſt we find out of <hi>Hottinger</hi> in his Oriental Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Petricides</hi> and <hi>Elma Cinus,</hi> Arabian Writers, have delivered to Poſterity, that there were at <hi>Nice</hi> 2300, which in truth can make nothing for Mr. <hi>Blount,</hi> the Queſtion was of Biſhops only, not of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers For <hi>Socrates, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Eccleſ.

And if we may be allowed to conſult Reaſon in hiſtorical Matters, I cannot do better then to cite <hi>Nicetas Coniates, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 9. where he gives this Reaſon why no more Biſhops met in ſo venerable an Aſſembly, becauſe Age and Sickneſs detained many, and that Biſhopricks were then thin ſowed, every little City being not then advanced into an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal See.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:93753:52"/>In <hi>Selden</hi> we find <hi>Eutychius</hi> affirming, that in the City of <hi>Nice</hi> were aſſembled 2400 Biſhops. According to Dr. <hi>Pocock</hi>'s Tranſlation, <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus Aegyptius</hi> affirms the number to be 2048. And the ſame is affirmed by <hi>Iſmael Ibn Ali,</hi> the Mahometan Hiſtorian. Theſe are the only Authors that I have any where obſerved to have been made uſe of by learned Men to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>To all which the Novelty of the Author is a ſufficient Anſwer. Certainly thoſe Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who liv'd in the Age when things are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted, and are Eye-witneſſes, and are a great part of the Affairs themſelves, are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved before others, that lived ſome hundred of Years after the things were done.</p>
                  <p>But ſince <hi>Iſmael Ibn Ali</hi> the Mahometan, ſeems more full to Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s purpoſe than the others, I will here tranſlate him.</p>
                  <p>About the End of the twentieth Year of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Emperor, there were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Council 2048 Biſhops; then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror choſe out of that number 318. And they did Excommunicate <hi>Arius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> becauſe he did aſſert that Chriſt was a Creature. The foreſaid Biſhops were conſenting to the Emperor's Pleaſure, and ſo they innovated and publiſhed a New Syſtem of Chriſtian Religion.</p>

                     <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who lived in thoſe Days, and was a Member of the Council, ſays in his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that the <hi>Vicennalia</hi> of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated at <hi>Rome,</hi> Anno 330. and that the Council was aſſembled Anno 325. So that this Trip of the Mahometans is an Argument that he made uſe of bad Records in compiling his Hiſtory. And whereas he ſays the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil innovated as to Religion, he writes like a Mahometan indeed, and not like a Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Miſteries of our Sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>We have therefore reaſon to believe, that as the Arabic Canons, falſly fathered on this Council, are exploded by all that have any Guſt of Criticiſm; ſo likewiſe will theſe Modern Arabic Pamphlets be rejected by all ſuch as will take the Pains to examine them.</p>

                  <p>What ſhould occaſion this grand Miſtake in our <hi>Deiſt,</hi> may without great difficulty be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: I do not find any ground for it in the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Hiſtorians before mentioned: but in that impudent Writer <hi>Sandius,</hi> pag 167.

condemned, <hi>cauſa inaudita multo minus rationibus expenſis: They were condemned,</hi> ſays He, <hi>without being heard;</hi> much leſs had they permiſſion to produce their Arguments and Reaſons.

Neither is this any wonder, for the <hi>Arians</hi> had for a long time the Sun-ſhine of the Secular Power. The Queſtion then is not of the Number of Synods, but of the Methods by which they did proceed: As to the <hi>Arian</hi> Methods, we have this account from <hi>Athanaſius;</hi>

                  <p>As to the Number of Biſhops pretended to be preſent at the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> there is ſome difference between our Author, and <hi>Sandius:</hi> the latter making the Number to be a thouſand or more: <hi>Interea qui</hi> Arimini <hi>convenerunt Pontifices numero millenarium excedente fuerunt.</hi> And this

to the <hi>Jews,</hi> accordingly as it is written by the Prophet, <hi>They have forſaken the fountain of living waters, and have digged to themſelves broken ciſterns, that cannot hold water.</hi> So theſe Men leaving the Sacred <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, have betaken themſelves to many <hi>Synods,</hi> which are in themſelves vain, and of no effect.</q> And yet at <hi>Ariminum</hi> there were no leſs than two hundred Diſſenters; and not three only (as Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> bears us in hand) that held the contrary.</p>

For this cauſe St.</hi> Jerom <hi>either in a Verſion, or in a Sleep, was beaten by the Devil: So that about the Year</hi> 400, <hi>a Council in</hi> Carthage <hi>did forbid to read the Books of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>but allowed them to read the Books of</hi> Hereticks, <hi>the Decrees whereof is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Canons, collected by</hi> Gratian, <hi>and this was the firſt Eccleſiaſtical Prohibition by way of Canon.</hi> Thus far <hi>Paul.</hi> And now I come to the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>The Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> which Father <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to, is that which is commonly called the 4th <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Council, whoſe 16th Canon is, — <hi>ut Epiſcopus Gentilium lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>That a Biſhop do not read the Books of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> but in reading the Books of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> He is to have regard to Neceſſity and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in this particular, I diſſent from <hi>Paul,</hi> and joyn with that great Antiquary <hi>Juſtellus,</hi> who in his Preface to the Code of the <hi>African</hi> Church, ſays, —<hi>Concilium quod vocant quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Carthaginenſe, plane repudiandum est, nec fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des adhibenda Canonibus</hi> 104 <hi>quos ſine auctoritate huic Concilio adſcribunt:</hi> 
                     <q>The Council, which is commonly called the fourth <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> is to be wholly rejected, neither is there any Faith to be given to the 104 Canons, which without any good Authority they aſcribe to it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no mention of theſe Canons in the Collection of <hi>Ferrandus;</hi> nor in that of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Exiguus;</hi> nor in the Code of the <hi>African</hi> Church; nor in the Collection commonly called the <hi>Afr.</hi> Council. In a Manuſcript that belonged to Cardinal <hi>Barberini,</hi> they are entituled <hi>Ancient Statutes of the Eaſtern Church.</hi> But theſe Canons themſelves prove the contrary. The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Ordination of the leſſer Orders, as they are ſate forth in this Council, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable enough to the Practice of the Weſtern Church, where theſe Orders were conferred by delivering holy Veſſels; but not to the Eaſtern Church, where theſe Orders were always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by Impoſition of Hands. In other Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93753:58"/>
they are entituled, <hi>The ancient Statutes of the Church.</hi> In a word, there can be no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon given, why they ſhould not be found in the ancient Collections, if they were genuine. The ancienteſt Author Father <hi>Paul</hi> cites is <hi>Gratian,</hi> whoſe teſtimony is of no weight, if not ſtrengthen'd by ſome collateral Evidence: For all know He is a perfect <hi>Rhapſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt,</hi> and this is ſo fully made out by <hi>Auguſt. Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raconenſis,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Emendat. Gratiani,</hi> that there is not any place left for the leaſt doubt. Which prejudice, together with that of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, may be objected againſt <hi>Iſidore, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardus, Hincmare, Ivo Carnotenſis, &amp;c.</hi> and the defence which <hi>Schelſtrate</hi> makes is ſo weak and dull, as that it ſavours little of a <hi>Vaticane</hi> Library keeper: whereas otherwiſe in his <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia Africana,</hi> He diſcovers much Learning and Reading.</p>
                  <p>I am now to conſult the Opinions of ſome in the Eaſtern Church, and to bring my reaſon for doing ſo.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> in the firſt Tome of his Works, hath a Homily, whoſe Title is, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. This Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was compos'd for young Men, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite them to read the Books of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but to direct them, and to ſhew what benefit they might reap thereby. Amongſt other things He takes notice that <hi>Moſes</hi> was educated in the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and ſo proceeded to the knowledge of the true God. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93753:58"/>
in following ages, <hi>Dauiel</hi> at <hi>Babylon</hi> learned the Learning of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and from thence proceeded to Divine Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, ad Seleucum Iambie.</hi> 3. treats of this matter, where he prohibits nothing as touching reading the Books of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but only lays down this Rule, <q>That from the ſame Plant Roſes may be gathered and Thorns, and that we ought to take one, and leave the other.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of theſe two citations is, to ſtop the mouths of thoſe, who pretend that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles prohibited the reading the Books of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and for that purpoſe quote chap. 5. of the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions; whoſe Title is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; concerning reading the Books of ſuch as are not within the pale of the Church.</p>
                  <p>To which there needs no other Reply, than the Teſtimonies of theſe two learned and pious Biſhops: <q>If there had been ſuch Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their times, they could never have written as they did.</q> Beſides the Authority of theſe pretended Conſtitutions, as to this point, is ſo fully refuted by Mr. <hi>Dalle</hi> in his Book <hi>de Pſeudopigr. Apoſtolicis,</hi> pag. 326. that there is no place left for a Reply.</p>
                  <p>I may add hereunto the Law of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, from <hi>Theodoret Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> lib. 4. c. 8. He firſt of all prohibited the uſe of <hi>Rhetoric, Poetry,</hi> and <hi>Philoſophick</hi> Arts to the children of the <hi>Galileans</hi> (ſo he called the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93753:59"/>
                     <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) and the reaſon of the Law is in theſe words: <hi>They wound us with our arrows, as it is in the Proverb; for out of our own Books they borrow arguments, which they make uſe of to our confuſion:</hi> And all know this to be true, who have read <hi>Tertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius</hi> and others, in their Controverſies with the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Corollaries and Inferences I ſhall make are very plain: Firſt, I affirm that there is no good Evidence for ſuch a Canon <hi>anno</hi> 400. much leſs Canons, as Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> ſays.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, That this pretended Canon was made 75 years after the holding of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Council; and therefore our <hi>Deiſt</hi> could not gather from this Canon the Ignorance of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> of thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>The Third is, That it cannot be preſumed that the Canons of the Church ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Decree of the Emperour <hi>Julian,</hi> which was made on purpoſe to eradicate the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; no more can it can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that <hi>Baſil</hi> and N <hi>zianzen</hi> would impugn an Apoſtolical Conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Learning of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply treated of by the Fathers of the 4 firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies; their <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Theology</hi> was ſo fully examined and refuted by them; that unleſs theſe Books had been prohibited, it was impoſſible for the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> of thoſe times to have been ignorant of all the ſolid Learning contained in the Books of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

                  <p>What our Author propoſes to Himſelf by this Method, is not very material; for ſince the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> are the Learned Languages, why may not one of them be ſufficient for a Clergy-man?

                  <p>What <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Opinion was of the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul, cannot be concluded from this paſſage. For he frequently contradicts Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this particular. And as <hi>Lipſius</hi> in the Third Book of His Stoical Phyſiology ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>aliquando accedit, aliquando recedit;</hi> ſometimes He affirms it, ſometimes He denieth it. In the 36th Epiſt. where He commends a certain perſon who removed from unavoidable Troubles in publick Affairs, and comforts Him againſt death, he hath theſe Expreſſions, <hi>Mors quam parti meſcimus &amp; recuſamus intermittit vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam non eripit; venet iterum, qui nos in lucem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponet dies.</hi> Death, which we ſo much fear, may intermit Life; it ſhall not wholly deprive us of it, the day will come which ſhall reſtore us from Death to Life. And if we add what follows <hi>(quem multi recuſarent niſi oblitos reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent)</hi> his Contradictions in this place will be both viſible and palpable. In his 63d Epiſtle, which was a Conſolatory one upon the Death of a Friend; and in the end of that Epiſtle he ſays, <hi>Et fortaſſe (ſi modo ſapientum vera fama eſt, recipit<expan>

Some wiſe men are of Opinion, that there is a common Receptacle for us all. And this makes <hi>Lipſius,</hi> in his Commentaries on this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93753:62"/>
place, to ſay, <hi>Dubie &amp; trepide ſuper immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate animae &amp; alias. Seneca</hi> philoſophizes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of the Immortality of the Soul, as he doth alſo in other places. And although Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> would in this page perſwade us, that <hi>Senecae</hi> is for the Mortality of the Soul, yet p. 124. he confeſſes the Contradiction himſelf; where he writes, <q>When I hear <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoſopher, and others, preaching up the doctrine of the Souls Immortality, with a <hi>quid mihi cura erit transfuga?</hi> tackt to the end of it, nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven ſeems to me more unaccountable and contradictory?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which we ſee what little regard is to be had to the Stoical Philoſophers, if you conſider them without their moral Sentences. He that hath but the leaſt Skill in Natural Philoſophy, cannot but perceive how groſly erroneous they are therein. They who make the great God Corporeal; they who make the Stars to feed on the Vapours of the Earth (in which abſurd Notion <hi>Seneca,</hi> with his Rhetorical Flouriſhes, ſeems to boaſt), they who make the Sun to drink up the Waters of the Sea to quench his Thirſt, and the Moon to drink up the Rivers; they (I ſay) who diſcourſe ſo unphiloſophically in theſe Phyſical Matters, if they err in the momentous point of the Souls Immortality, it cannot be accounted ſtrange.</p>
                  <p>Natural Religion being, according to our Author, grounded on the immortality of the Soul; and yet, as it will appear hereafter, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93753:62"/>
this immortality cannot certainly be known but by Scripture and the Parſons harangues (as He, by way of contempt, ſays, p. 118.) and not by the Reaſons of <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> muſt be very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which our Deiſts Hypotheſis will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

The great Art in managing this Argument, conſiſts in confounding the Senſe of thoſe ſeveral places of holy Scripture, which are to be interpreted a part from each other; as is obſerved in <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Creed, p. 223. the <hi>Preacher</hi> in this Book ſets forth the beginning, progreſs and ripeneſs of his Diſquiſition, concerning the Happineſs of man: Wherefore in the beginning of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, he ſetteth down his raw Apprehenſions; and he relateth in the firſt and ſecond Chapters, how he once thought Folly equal with Wiſdom, and that there was nothing better than to eat, and drink; and what adventures and tryals he made towards the better underſtanding of what was good for the Sons of Men. In his third Chapter, he declareth how full of Myſtery he found the works of God (ver. 11.) and how little was manifeſt, eſpecially to ſenſual Men, of the future State: But in the 11 and 12 Chapters, wherein he declareth his advanced judgment, and calleth Men off from the World, to the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Averroes</hi> (as <hi>Richer</hi> aſſerts, lib. 4. Hiſt. Gen. Concil. par. ult. p. 22.) was condemned in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, under <hi>Leo</hi> the X. becauſe he held, That there was one only Soul in all Men;

which is the Univerſal Soul, the <hi>Anima Mundi.</hi> Whereas 'tis certain that every Man hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Soul of his own. So that this Doctrine of <hi>Averroes</hi> tends to the ſubverſion of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety: a Doctrine fit for the Devil. For as <hi>Cardan</hi> (in his 19. Book <hi>de Subtil</hi>) tells us, the talleſt of the <hi>Daemons</hi> that talked with his Father, <hi>Palam Averroiſtam ſe profitebatur,</hi> told him plainly, <hi>That he was an</hi> Averroiſt.</p>

                     <hi>Pomponatius</hi> (as Dr. <hi>More lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Immortal. anim. c.</hi> 16. informs us) was of opinion, that there were not as many particular Souls, as Men.

                     <hi>Cardan</hi> (to whom he eſpecially refers the moſt Ingenious <hi>Strephon,</hi> p. 117.) affirms the Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be from <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> that <hi>Jupiter</hi> being in the Aſcendant was the cauſe of his ſo ſoon diſputing with the Doctors in the Temple: that it was <hi>Saturn</hi> tendred him ſad; whence <hi>Joſephus</hi> took occaſion to ſay, —<hi>Viſus eſt ſaepius flere, ridere nunquam.</hi> That <hi>Jupiter</hi> meeting with <hi>Venus,</hi> was the cauſe of our <hi>Lord</hi>'s having red Specks in his Face; for which he

                  <p>That the Arguments which are brought from the Holy Scriptures, are only ſufficient to prove the Immortality of the Soul; and the Rewards and Puniſhments of a Future State, hath been
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93753:66"/>
proved already: and it will appear to be ſo, by what remains to be ſaid, with reſpect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Yet our Author, altho' he appeals to their Authority, can have no benefit thereof: Foraſmuch as he makes our Saviour and <hi>Moſes Politicians,</hi> p. 121. <hi>And perhaps theſe Lawgivers eſtabliſhed the Immortality of the Soul, not ſo much out of regard to Truth, as to Honeſty, hoping thereby to induce Men to Virtue,</hi> p. 123.</p>
                  <p>His perhaps cannot excuſe him from Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and a deſign of Subverting the <hi>Holy Oracles.</hi> For how little regard he hath for them, appears from his Parentheſis concerning the Duration of Future Rewards and Puniſhments, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures being poſitive, as well in the one, as in the other; and the Duration of them is of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to compleat the Juſtice of God, as to perſect the Happineſs of Man, not only in this World, but in that which is to come, if the Scriptures be true.</p>
                  <p>What he ſays of the Arguments which may be deduced from <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> we will now examine; and produce the ſtrongeſt, and moſt inſiſted on. This Argument is laid down by <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> made uſe of by <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Tuſculan</hi> Queſtions, Book the firſt, and in his ſixth Book of a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> is always preferr'd by <hi>Tully</hi> before <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> and is called by him <hi>The God of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</hi> And now let us ſee how he proves the Soul's Immortality, on which depend Future
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93753:67"/>
Rewards and Puniſhments: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. That is that mighty Argument which <hi>Plato</hi> calls a Demonſtration; and concludes this is ſufficient for the demonſtration thereof.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Analyſis</hi> of which is; The Soul is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Motion; that which is always in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is Self-moving; that which is Self-moving, is never deſerted of it ſelf; that which never deſerts it ſelf, never ceaſes to move; that which never ceaſes to move, is the Source and Origin of all Motion; that which is the Source of all Motion, hath no Beginning; and that which hath no Beginning, hath no Ending.</p>
                  <p>Whereas every Propoſition is either falſe or uncertain, or incoherent, as Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> in his Cenſure of the Platonick Philoſophy hath obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Many ſuch like trifling Argumentations are remarked by <hi>Baptiſta Criſpus.</hi> And <hi>Theopompus</hi> truly maintains that many of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dialogues are trifling and falſe, as many of them are ſtolen
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93753:67"/>
out of the Diſcourſes of <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> or <hi>Antiſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> or <hi>Bryſon</hi> of <hi>Heraclea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can any Man in his right Wits imagine that the immortality of the Soul can be proved from hence? Can any Man think that <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf thought this to be a good Proof? Certainly I think notwithſtanding his Boaſts of a Demonſtration, he could not be ſo vain, nor ſo illogical, as to think ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manimus Tyrius,</hi> in his 28th Diſſertation, tells us, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was the firſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher among the Greeks, who did dare (<gap reason="foreign">

Whereas if this had been a Matter of abſolute Neceſſity antecedent to Revelation, there had been no ſuch Preſumption in <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras.</hi> So that this Argument (of great Weight, as he calls it) is of no Weight at all. It may perhaps become the Harangues of the Parſons (as our Author ſcornfully writes, <hi>p.</hi> 118.) in a Country Auditory, but is very unbecoming ſuch a Damaſippus and great Bearded Philoſopher, as our Author is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Admirers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pythagoras</hi> alſo (according to the foreſaid Author) is ſaid to be the firſt who aſſerted the Pre-exiſtence of Souls; which was a very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion amongſt the Ancients. Of this Opinion were the Gymnoſophiſts, and other wiſe Men of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Brachmans of <hi>India,</hi> the Magi of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> as appears plainly by the Magical Oracles of <hi>Zoroaſter</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:93753:68"/>
with the Scholies of <hi>Pletho,</hi> and the Chaldaic Oracle with the Scholies of <hi>Pſellus:</hi> Nay, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf was of this Opinion, as is to be ſeen in his ſecond Book, <hi>De Generat. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. c.</hi> 3. where his Opinion of the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul and Pre-exiſtence are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, as if the one did ſuppoſe the other. Now the Arguments made uſe of were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively drawn from the Soul's Operations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable to the Body; which is the beſt Argument Natural Reaſon can ſuggeſt. The Method of our Author is wholly new, and the Weakneſs of it rather Subverts then Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth what it pretends.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I ſhall conclude this Subject in the Words of the moſt learned Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>Origines Sacrae, p.</hi> 608, and 609.</p>

                     <q>The Scriptures give the moſt faithful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the State and Condition of the Soul of Man. The World was almoſt loſt in Diſputes concerning the Nature, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Immortality of the Soul, before Divine Revelation was made known to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by the Goſpel of Chriſt; but Life and Immortality was brought to Light by the Goſpel, and the future State of the Soul of Man not diſcovered in an uncertain Platonical way, but with the greateſt Light and Evidence from that God who hath the Supream Diſpoſal of Souls, and therefore beſt knows and underſtands them.

So that the Goſpel of Chriſt is the fulleſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Diſcovery of the certainty of the future State of the Soul, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which abide it, upon its being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged from the Body.</q>

                  <p>I do not remember Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reaſon (why he omitted the Tranſlation of the fifth Book of <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s Hiſtory) either in his Epiſtle to the Reader, or in his Notes, or in any other of his Learned Works. But I ſuppoſe the true Reaſon was becauſe <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s account of the Jews is full of Slanders, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoods, and Contradictions. Wherefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Tacitus</hi> (tho' in other things an excellent Hiſtorian) <hi>mendaciorum pleniſſimus ſcriptor;</hi> a Writer who abounded with Lies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tacitus</hi> in many places of his Account is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Holy Scriptures, ſo that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may ceaſe his Admiration, if he be in earneſt in the 134th Page of his Book, where he thus writes; <hi>The Relations</hi> of Trogus Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, <hi>and the reſt, are only the uncertain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of partial Authors, ſince the best and only Hiſtory extant to be relied on for this Subject is the Holy Scriptures, dictated as every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to believe by the Holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whoſomever conſiders that <hi>Deiſm</hi> is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Chriſtianity (as I have proved) may juſtly admire at theſe laſt Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I cannot liken Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> to any Man but to him in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who was half White and half Black; or to him in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93753:69"/>
that out of the ſame Mouth blowed both Hot and Cold.</p>
                  <p>But he may in ſome faſhion be excuſed, for he hath really obſerved <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Rule, relating to the Title of his Book. That of <hi>Cardan</hi> in the 19th Book, <hi>De Subtilitate,</hi> is here verified (and he ſays, demonſtrated in his Book, <hi>De Fato) Si Oracula ambigua non eſſent, non eſſent Oracula.</hi> If theſe Oracles are not Ambiguous and Contradictory, they would not be Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Oracles.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot but admire that Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> ſhould be guilty of the ſame fault, of which he accuſes Sir <hi>Henry Savil,</hi> for he Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates not much above two Thirds of <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s account of the Jews. Shall we ſay he did this to complement the Jewiſh, and to rob the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Nation of the Spirit behind? Was he not obliged to do it for his deſervedly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and moſt Ingenious Major <hi>A.</hi> as he calls him, <hi>p.</hi> 126? Or ſhall we ſay that he only ſeparated the Dregs for his ingenious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>A?</hi> I am ſure he hath been very diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in his Tranſlation, for he hath not only abuſed his Major, but his Reader alſo; nay, <hi>Tacitus</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays that the Jews did, <hi>Effigiem ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis, quo monſtratore errorem ſitimque depulerant, penetrali ſacravere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which place he thus Tranſlates, <hi>They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Conſecrated the Effigies of an Aſs, for being
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93753:70"/>
their Guide to the Waters where they ſatisfied their Thirſt.</hi> Whereas <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Aſs, unleſs <hi>Animal</hi> be Latin for an Aſs.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays they conſecrated an Animal <hi>in penetrali,</hi> that is, their Holy of Holies— he omitted that Word. The Lye was ſo great that the ingenious Major could not ſwallow it.</p>
                  <p>For my part I cannot conjecture why he ſhould only tranſlate two Thirds, and omit the other, but that he conceived the Part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſlated would have ſpoiled his Project. For there is a palpable Contradiction in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> which renders his Account Fabulous. In the Part untranſlated, <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays, <hi>Aegyptii Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies venerantur, Judai ſola mente.</hi> The Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans worſhip Images, the Jews abhor them. <hi>Tacitus</hi> alſo adds, <hi>Judaei nulla ſimulachra habent in urbibus nedum in Templis.</hi> The Jews have no Graven Images nor Idols to be ſeen in their Cities, much leſs in their Temples.

                  <p>We know nothing for certain concerning the Inſtitution of Divine Worſhip but from <hi>Moſes.</hi> And from him, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. ver. 26.) we learn, <hi>That Men began to call upon the Name of the Lord in the Days of</hi> Enos.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the firſt Book of his Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Chap. 4. ſays, <q>That for ſeven Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations Men perſevered in Worſhipping the true God, and had a regard to Vertue; but in proceſs of Time Men degenerated and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:93753:71"/>That <hi>Moſes</hi> was inſtituted in the Egyptian Learning we readily grant; he was accounted but ſome of the Gentiles an Egyptian Prieſt; but the ſame cannot be affirmed of <hi>Abraham. Joſephus</hi> is very plain, when in the firſt Book of his Antiquities, Chap. 9. he aſſerts, <hi>That the Egyptians learned all the Knowledge they had in</hi> Arithmetick <hi>and</hi> Aſtronomy <hi>from</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
                  <p>

                     </gap>. When <hi>Abraham</hi> came into <hi>Egypt</hi> he taught the Egyptians <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> and <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,</hi> of which they were ignorant before. So that the Knowledge of theſe Sciences came firſt from the Chaldeans to the Egyptians, and from them to the Greeks.</p>
                  <p>Whether <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Jews took Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion from the Egyptians, hath been a Subject of great Diſpute. The well known place in <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſeems to me to ſay ſo much, although our late great Critick, <hi>Biſnagius,</hi> in his <hi>Exerc. Hiſt. Critic. (p.</hi> 119.) will by no means grant it. <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Annotations on the 1ſt Book of the Truth of Chriſt Religion, cites <hi>Herodotus</hi> at large, and chargeth <hi>Herodotus</hi> with reporting an Untruth. He doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſays, that the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that they learned the Rite of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Jews: but he ſays <hi>Herodotus</hi> did them an Injury in ſaying ſo. <hi>Tantum vero abeſt</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:93753:71"/>
(ſays <hi>Grotius) ut Judaei faſſi ſunt unquam ab Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptiis ſe accepiſſe hunc ritum, ut contra aperte dicunt Aegyptios ab Joſepho didiciſſe circumcidi;</hi> 'Tis ſo far from Truth, that the Jews ſhould confeſs that they received this Rite from the Egyptians; that on the contrary they boldly affirm that the Egyptians learned Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Joſeph.</hi> And for this <hi>Grotius</hi> in the place cited refers to Authorities.</p>
                  <p>What Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> writes concerning <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the Hiſtorian, is of no moment. <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the 8th.

Children, after the ſame number of days.</p>
                  <p>From which it neceſſarily follows, That <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> his Opinion of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> was very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of <hi>Herodotus:</hi> He ſays the <hi>Jews</hi> had it from the <hi>Egyptians; Joſephus</hi> ſays, they had it from <hi>God,</hi> and that they might be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from other Nations; and conſequently <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was among the <hi>Jews</hi> long before the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had it. So that Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> may juſtly be accuſed of <hi>Incogitancy,</hi> and of not Reading the Authors he cites.</p>
                  <p>Of this Opinion, or not much differing from it, was <hi>Photius,</hi> that Learned Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> in his 205th. Ep. to <hi>Theod. Hegumenos.</hi>

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <q>The <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity, was inſtituted as an Emblem of Reſtraint from Inceſtuous Copulations:</q> The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did lie with their Mothers, Daughters, and Siſters, by a wicked and abominable Cuſtom.

                     <q>It is lawful to marry two Siſters: The firſt Text of Scripture which is commonly urged in this caſe, is that of marrying a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Wife, which ſeems to be forbidden; where by a ſide wind, they would bring in that of marrying a wife's Siſter, as parallel, ſaying, <hi>Ubi eadem ratio, ibi idem Jus;</hi> but with their Pardon, the Simile doth not run upon four feet; the reaſon is not the ſame, for the words (in <hi>Leviticus 18.</hi> and <hi>16.</hi>) which forbid the marrying a Brother's Wife, ſay, <hi>Becauſe a Man thereby uncovers his Brother's naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> which ſeems not at all to be a good reaſon againſt marrying the Wife's Siſter; becauſe every Man is ſuppoſed to have diſcovered his firſt Wife's nakedneſs before any ſuch Marriage with her Siſter.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>Our Author's Opinion concerning Marrying two Siſters, ſeems to me grounded on that which He <hi>calls</hi> (in the 106 p. of his Book) <hi>the bewitching ſmiles of a Woman;</hi> whom he there
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93753:73"/>
unhandſomly denominates, <hi>The moſt lovely Brute of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> And I doubt not but his Friend <hi>Toriſmond</hi> (as he calls him p. 135.) looks on it as his beſt Argument.</p>
                  <p>We do not ſay that Similies always run on four feet, but I am ſure the preſent Similies do. The reaſon of the Law is the ſame, both as to Brothers and Siſters: And whereas he ſays, <hi>Every Man is ſuppoſed to have diſcovered his firſt Wife's nakedneſs;</hi> He ſeemeth not to underſtand the Scripture Phraſe, which is only uſed with relation to a turpitude committed by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Marriage. If a Woman marries her Father, ſhe diſcovers the nakedneſs of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Scriptural ſenſe; tho' in our Author's Unſcriptural ſenſe, Her Mother's nakedneſs was diſcovered before by Her Father.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor Hebraica,</hi> Book firſt Chap. 6. tells us (that whereas we read in the 16th. Verſe of the 18th. Chapter, <hi>It is thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's nakedneſs</hi>) in a moſt ancient Copy of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion, in the <hi>King</hi>'s Library at Saint <hi>James</hi>'s: Inſtead of <hi>Turpitudo eſt fratri tui,</hi> the words are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>She is thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Wife: Quaſi</hi> (ſays <hi>Selden) ipſo nomine ſeu turpitudinis, ſeu nuditatis fratris foemina, ſeu uxor ejus expreſſim nominaretur:</hi> 
                     <q>As if (ſays he) he by the words <hi>turpitude,</hi> or <hi>nakedneſs,</hi> of this Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Woman, or his Wife, was expreſly named.</q> If this Remark of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s be well, it is of good uſe: So that the Reaſon of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93753:74"/>
Law is the ſame in marrying of two Siſters, as marrying a Brother's Wife.</p>
                  <p>The Senſe of the Law with Relation to Brothers, is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not uncover the nakedneſs of thy Brother's Wife, for it is thy Brother's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</hi> And by a parity of reaſon, <hi>Thou ſhalt not uncover the nakedneſs of thy wife's Siſter,; for it is thy Wife's nakedneſs.</hi> What our Author ſays concerning Penal Laws, that they are ty'd up to the very Letter, is true; but it hath no place, <hi>ubi eadem oratio,</hi> Where there is the ſame reaſon. And therefore the <hi>Karans,</hi> or <hi>Scripturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> (who are oppoſed to the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> or <hi>Traditionals</hi>) that bind themſelves moſt to the Scripture Rule, have reſolved this matter: Firſt, that there is place for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Deduction, from the words of the Law: Secondly, that whatſoever can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thence, either <hi>a fortiori,</hi> or <hi>a pari;</hi> either becauſe the remoter degree is prohibited, or that which is equally remote, is to be deemed piouſly and rightfully concluded.</p>
                  <p>Thus when ver. 7. the Father and Mother are both named; and v. 12. <hi>The Father's Siſter:</hi> And v. 13. <hi>The Mother's Siſter:</hi> And v. 14. <hi>The Father's Brother:</hi> yet the Mother's Brother is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; nor the Siſter's Daughter, which would be equivalent with that. And yet this being the Marriage of the Uncle on the Mother's ſide with the Neece, which is of the ſame diſtance with the Uncle of the Father's ſide, with the Neece, and the Aunt on the Mother's ſide, with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93753:74"/>
the Nephew, from the naming and prohibition of theſe, ver. 13 and 14. by the parity of reaſon, that which is not named, is by all reſolved to be prohibited.</p>
                  <p>And as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> p. 436. hath obſerv'd, juſt thus it is in this matter. The Wife's Siſter, which is not named, is directly in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Propinquity, with the Brother's Wife, which is named and prohibited.</p>

                        <hi>The Canon of Scripture, which ſeems more nearly to concern this caſe, is</hi> Leviticus 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>where it is ſaid,</hi> Neither ſhalt thou take a wife to her ſiſter to vex her, to uncover her nakedneſs, beſides the other in her life time: <hi>But this doth not therefore ſeem to reſtrain or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the marrying of two ſiſters one after the other; for the first being dead, the other cannot be a Rival or vexation (as the Text calls it) to her dead ſiſter: And then how ſhall the Prohibition be urg'd, if the reaſon of it be removed? it is rationally apparent that there is great ſtreſs placed in thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> (during her life) <hi>and</hi> (to vex her, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering her ſhame upon her) <hi>as doth more fully appear in our Tranſlation of the Bible in Queen</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth<hi>'s Reign, printed</hi> An.

                  <p>If, as Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> ſays p. 137. all Penal Laws are ſtraitly ty'd up to the expreſs Letter of the Law (where there is <hi>par ratio,</hi> the like or ſame reaſon) and no where to be conſtrued by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93753:75"/>
he hath loſt more for his purpoſe in this place of holy Scripture, than he got by the former. For then nothing can be concluded from this place of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> for marrying a Wife's Siſter after her death, the expreſs Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law mentions nothing of it. All that can be ſaid for it from this place, is by dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and conſequence.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore give a full Solution in the words of the foreſaid Learned Doctor: p. 437. if by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reading of our Bibles, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 18. ver. 18. <hi>(Neither ſhalt thou take a wife to her ſiſter to vex ber, to uncover her nakedneſs, beſide the other in her life-time)</hi> it be thought that the marrying the Wife's Siſter in her life time, be the only thing forbidden, that will preſently be anſwered from the margent of our Tranſlation, where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is fitly and truly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>[Not a wife to her ſiſter]</hi> but <hi>[one wife to another]</hi> and ſo is a direct Prohibition of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy;</hi> at leaſt, when the firſt is deprived and vexed, by taking in of the ſecond, but not a Permiſſion to marry, that was otherwiſe prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>

                  <p>The miſtake of <hi>Grotius</hi> (mention'd p. 139.) proceeds from his not conſulting the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as appears from what hath been written before, from the Margent of our Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtolical Canon, ſo much uſed in this Controverſy, is the 19. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now as <hi>Grotius,</hi> and after him our Author, were miſtaken, by following the vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation, ſo they are both here miſtaken in their Inference from this Canon. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Anſwer to this Difficulty, is moſt excellent; I will ſet it down in his own words: <q>Where if it be thought, that this is no mark of the unlawfulneſs of the thing, but only an Interdict to the Clergy, that they ſhall not marry thus, leaving it free to others: this will be the ſame ſtrange way of arguing, as if from the Qualifications of the Biſhop, ſet down by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould be no drunkard, no covetous perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> i. e. that ſuch as are ſo, ſhould not be admitted to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93753:76"/>
holy Orders, we ſhould conclude that theſe Qualities might be free and lawful for other Men, who were not Eccleſiaſticks; or becauſe the Biſhop muſt be one that hath not married after ſuch divorces, as are forbidden by <hi>Christ;</hi> and the Widow is to be the Wife but of one Husband in like manner, it were therefore law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for all other Chriſtians to uſe ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces, and marry again, which we know was prohibited by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or that other Chriſtian Women might have more Husbands, or leave one, and marry another; which we know was never lawful among any Civil, tho' Heathen People. The plain of it is, that the only thing concluſible from the Interdicts of the Church Canons, is the frequency of ſuch practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Unbelievers, which made it neceſſary to revive and refreſh the Prohibition to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: To whom, under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſuch Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages were reputed ſo foul, and the ſtate of ſuch ſins being permanent, did ſo muchen hance them above the nature of ſingle acts of greater ſins; that, altho' for every commiſton of any known ſin, a Man were not made uncapable of any Dignity in the Church (or rendred irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, if after the receiving Orders, he were found guilty) yet of theſe ſins he that were once guilty, ſhould for ever remain under a brand, and be counted uncapable of Holy Orders, which he that were otherwiſe worthy, would not ſurely have been, had it not been accounted unlawful, before that Canon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93753:76"/>
that puniſhment on the offender. And then it being acknowledged that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not deſcended to the ſpecifying of ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; and that the Apoſtle that ſpeaketh of one ſuch ſin, ſaith it was not named among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the reſult will be, that this brand of the Apoſtolical Canon, is founded in the Univerſal Prohibition, obliging all Men, and ſo the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of all Nations, as well as the <hi>Jews;</hi> and that not abrogated, but confirm'd, and by ſtricter Precepts of Continence, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations againſt the Incontinent, continued on the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi>

                  <p>For I am perſwaded there was ſuch a Law among the <hi>Athenians.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> in his Tranſlation, hath changed the <hi>ipſa,</hi> She, into <hi>ipſi,</hi> Him; the Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into the Dative.

                  <p>I much admire how <hi>Grotius</hi> could gather out of this Council, that the Bond of ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony ſhould remain inviolable, ſince the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non makes no mention thereof, 'tis very illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical to conclude ſo peremptorily from the ſilence of tne Council, and from a Negative to infer ſuch an Affirmative, which we have reaſon to think repugnant to the Opinion of the Council. If a Man commits Inceſt by Marryng his Daughter, the higheſt Spiritual Puniſhment the Church can inflict is Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; how unreaſonable would it be to conclude from hence, that the Church did adjudge the Bond of ſuch a Matrimony to be inviolable?</p>

                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:93753:78"/>That Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> did err in this Concluſion, is a thing not much to be wondred at; <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>'s Authority is a probable Apology for an Error. Would to God he had followed him in all things. But in this Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> is blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that he is not agreeable to himſelf. His Rule, (<hi>p.</hi> 137.) is, <hi>That Penal Laws are ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be tied to the expreſs Letter of the Law.</hi> If this be true, he hath tranſgreſſed his own Rule in his Reduction and Inference from this Canon, which is purely Penal; the greateſt Puniſhment in the Old Canon Law is Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as <hi>Duarenus</hi> hath it in his Body of the Canon Law.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame is aſſerted by <hi>Petrus de Marca,</hi> in his Book, <hi>de Concordia,</hi> by <hi>Widdrincton,</hi> in his Apology for Princes, by <hi>Richerius,</hi> in his Book of Eccleſiaſtical Authority, and others who are reputed moſt Learned in the Roman Communion.</p>
                  <p>This Puniſhment is inflicted on Inceſt, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide, Adultery, and other grievous Crimes. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his firſt Book, <hi>Contra adverſ.

                  <p>This Caſe of Marrying two Siſters was much agitated in the Primitive Times; the Apoſtolical Canons, and the Council of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris,</hi> are ſufficient Proofs hereof. In the times of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> this Queſtion was Controverted; eſpecially between him and one <hi>Diodorus,</hi> or by one under his Name; (as appears out of St. <hi>Baſil, Epiſt.</hi> 197.) and as great brags were then made, as now by Mr. <hi>Blount.</hi> And this Oracle was then carried about as a Trophy, over that eminent Father.</p>
                  <p>The excellent Reply St. <hi>Baſil</hi> made, may make us ceaſe to wonder why <hi>Grotius</hi> did not cite it. To be ſure his Silence is a ſufficient Shield for Mr. <hi>Blount,</hi> we will therefore tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate what is there written, and paſs over the Original which is very long.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe (ſays he) the Writer of the Epiſtle by corrupt Argumentation hath endeavoured to induce Men into the Commiſſion of ſo gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evous a Sin: It is a neceſſary Duty incumbent on us to prevent the ſame by true Ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Epiſtle ſays 'tis written in <hi>Leviticus, Thou ſhalt not Marry thy Wife's Siſter to vex her, whilſt ſhe is living.</hi> From whence (ſaith the Epiſtle) 'tis manifeſt, you may Marry her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter when your Wife is dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:93753:80"/>We are asked, Whether it is not written, <hi>That a Man may Marry his Wife's Siſter?</hi> We ſay it is a certain Truth, that no ſuch thing is written. No Perſon but the Legiſlator ought by virtue of any Conſequence to infer any thing from the ſilence of a Law. For if this Liberty be allowed, a Man may Marry his Wife's Siſter tho' his Wife be Living. For this, Sophiſm will ſerve that turn too; 'tis written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take thy Siſter, that ſhe may not vex thy Wife;</hi> therefore where there is no Vexation in the caſe, the thing is lawful. They who are for this Opinion may ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that there will be no Vexation nor Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſies between the two Siſters. Wherefore the Cauſe being removed, for which the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator prohibited a Man to have two Siſters to Wife at one time, What ſhould hinder it? But you will ſay this is not written in the Law; neither (ſay I) is the other there writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. But, I ſay, if Conſequences be allowed, the Conſequence is equal on either ſide, it grants equal Licenſe and Liberty.</p>
                  <p>How much this ſort of Marriage was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the Ancient Chriſtians, St. <hi>Baſil</hi> abundantly declares, when in his Epiſtle he makes <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I do not remember that I have met with a greater Diſingenuity in any Author, than I have here found in this place of Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s. I have conſulted <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Inſtitutes, with the Commentaries of <hi>Antonius Contius, Jacobus Gothofredus,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Acourſius,</hi> and I cannot find the place cited in any of theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. There is a place or two <hi>(Tit. de Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis)</hi> concerning Marrying two Wifes, but not a Word of Marrying two Siſters. So that I have reaſon to think, that Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> wilfully and fraudulently changed theſe Words, <hi>duas uxores,</hi> (twice uſed in that Title) into <hi>duas ſorores;</hi> two Wifes into two Siſters; although

                  <p>What he deſigns by this Query (his other Queries have either nothing to the purpoſe, or have been already anſwered) I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; conſidering his Conceſſions relating to the 99th Canon, and the Table of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſet forth by Authority, 1563.

                  <p>The Expoſition of this Place with reſpect to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is evident from the Conſent of the Ancient Jews, who never underſtood it in any other manner. All the old <hi>Paraphraſts,</hi> call, <hi>Shilo</hi> the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> renders it expreſly untill the time, when King <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall come. <hi>Jonathan</hi> renders it untill the time when <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall come. <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kilos</hi> untill <hi>Meſſiah</hi> come, whoſe is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The <hi>Talmud</hi> alſo reckons <hi>Shilo,</hi> among the Names of the <hi>Meſſiah. Hoornbeck</hi> writing of the Converſion of the Jews, reckons the Concurrence of divers Rabbies to this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: And to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Morney du Pleſsis,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Truth of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, cap.</hi> 27. all which Authorities aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that the Ancient Jews underſtood this Propheſy of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and that this was no Imagination, according to a <hi>Fantaſtick Cabbala,</hi> as is wickedly ſuggeſted.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this expoſition is Confirmed, by the Words which follow, <hi>To him ſhall the gathering of the People be.</hi> For this is the ſame Character, by which he was declared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> He was ſignified alſo by this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, In that day there ſhall be a Root of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>which ſhall ſtand for an Enſign of the People; to it ſhall the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles

                     <hi>ſeek, and his reſt ſhall be Glorious.</hi> As alſo in the Prophet <hi>Micah, The Mountain of the Houſe of the Lord ſhall be Eſtabliſhed on the top of the Mountains, and it ſhall be Exalted above the Hills, and the People ſhall flow unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus the Bleſſing of <hi>Judah</hi> is plainly underſtood, Judah <hi>thou art He whom thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhall praiſe. Thy hand ſhall be in the Neck of thine Enemies, thy Fathers Children ſhall bow down before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Bleſſing was to make way for a greater. This Government was not to fail, until there came a Son out of <hi>Judah</hi>'s Loyns greater than Him. For whereas <hi>Judah</hi>'s Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion reached only to the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the Dominion of Him who came out of His Loyns ſhould be over the World, all Nations ſhall ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that this Expoſition is not only according to the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> but according to the Scriptures themſelves: How greatly hath Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> erred, in affirming that this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was occaſioned by the introduction of Sects among the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                  <p>If this way of arguing be good, there is no general Opinion concerning any thing: <hi>Leo Modena,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the preſent <hi>Jews,</hi> (p. 249.) acquaints us, that the 12th.

                  <p>The Propheſies of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> which expreſly point at the time of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and concur with our JESUS, are very conſiderable. The Propheſy in the 9th. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ver. 24, 25 and 26. <hi>Seventy Weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in the everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the viſion and propheſy, and to anoint the most holy:</hi> Ver. 25. <hi>Know therefore and underſtand, that from the going forth of the commandment, to reſtore and rebuild</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>unto the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>the Prince, ſhall be ſeven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks; the ſtreet ſhall be built again, and the war, even in troublous times:</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>And after threeſcore and two weeks ſhall</hi> Meſſiah <hi>be cut off, but not for Himſelf; and the people of the Prince
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93753:86"/>
that ſhall come, ſhall deſtroy the city, and the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and the end thereof ſhall be with a flood, and unto the ends of the war deſolations are determined:</hi> Ver. 27. <hi>And he ſhall confirm the Covenant with many for one week, and in the midſt of the week, he ſhall cauſe the ſacrifice and oblation to ceaſe, and for the overſpreading of Abominations; he shall make it deſolate, even until the conſummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the deſolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Propheſy is clearly meant of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> becauſe here we have not only his Name, but his Sufferings; and the account of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, not for himſelf, but the People. The ancient Jews underſtood this place of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah: Hoornbeck</hi> to this purpoſe tells us, that R. <hi>Saadias a gaon,</hi> Rabbi <hi>Naahman Gerundenſis,</hi> and divers others expound this place of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> At laſt he gives us <hi>Manaſſe Ben Iſrael,</hi> which being very material, I ſhall quote it at large out of him: <hi>Verum ut addam illud interpretationis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus prophetiae, varie etiam illa ab hujus aevi</hi> Hebraeis <hi>explicata eſt, neque illud mirum cuique videre debet, ſi in prophetia tam obſcura variant ſententiae.</hi> 
                     <q>But that I might add this of the Interpretation of this Propheſy, for this is variouſly expounded by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of this Age: neither let this be a wonder to any, if there be a difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in ſo obſcure a Propheſy.</q> There are therefore thoſe who take theſe 70 weeks ſo, that they ſay, After the end of them the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> is to come, who would conſtitute the Jews Lords of the whole Earth. And this truly all
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93753:87"/>
thoſe did imagine that took arms againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour: and altho' they were obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to many miſeries and labours, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they always placed their hope in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come; becauſe they thought he would afford the ſight of himſelf when they were in the midſt of their miſeries: wherefore theſe words, <hi>To finish tranſgreſsions,</hi> they expounded, That after the expiration of 70 weeks, ſins are pardoned. Thus far <hi>Hoorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> out of <hi>Menaſſe Ben Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have here an evident teſtimony, that the Jews that lived about the time of the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> looked for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> then to come, becauſe they thought <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Period was then ended; and tho' (by miſtake) they expected a temporal Prince, yet 'tis evident they thought this Propheſy did concern the time, when the <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould come. That which is moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult here, is, the direct time of the <hi>Meſsias</hi>'s cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, is told us under the name of ſo many Weeks; which are not to be underſtood in our common acceptation of the word, but are to be taken for Years. The word <hi>Weeks</hi> in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſignifieth ſometime the ſpace of ſeven Days, as here in this Propheſy, 10. ch. ver. 2. where <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays, <q>That he mourned three Weeks, or ſevenets of Days:</q> And in the 16. of <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 9. ver. where commandment is given, <q>Seven Weeks ſhalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the ſeven Weeks from ſuch time as thou beginneſt to put the ſickle to the corn.</q>

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:93753:87"/>The word <hi>Weeks</hi> is ſometime taken for Years in Scripture, and containeth ſeven Years: As in the 29. chap. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> ver. 27. <q>Fulfil her Week, and we will give thee this alſo, for the ſervice which thou ſhalt ſerve with me yet ſeven other Years.</q> As alſo <hi>Leviticus</hi> ch. 25. ver. 8. <q>And thou ſhalt number ſeven Sabbaths of Years unto thee, ſeven times ſeven Years, and the ſpace of the ſeven Sabbaths of Years ſhall be unto thee forty and nine Years.</q>

                  <p>In this Signification the Word is to be taken in this place, underſtanding by 70 Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, 490 Years, having Proof thereof from Holy Scripture, and Prophane Authors.</p>
                  <p>And to thoſe before mentioned we may add, <hi>Cenſorinus de die Natali, c.</hi> 14. and <hi>Macrobius,</hi> Book firſt, <hi>in Somnium Scipionis, c.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe who ſtretch the Word further to a Sevenet of Tenths, or Jubilies, or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Years, as ſome have done, their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

hath neither warrant of God's Word, nor any likelyhood of Truth.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Difficulty is about the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe Weeks, concerning which we need not ſay any thing, conſidering that thoſe muſt be wilfully blind that deny the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
                  <p>But our Author is not to be born withal, as to what he ſays concerning the Prophecy's Authority; and that the Jews reckon it not among their Canonical Books.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Simon,</hi> who had well weighed this Point in his Critical Hiſtory of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Book 1. Chap. 9. ſays, <hi>There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned Men who find fault, that the Jews ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> Daniel <hi>from the number of the Prophets, and</hi> Theodoret <hi>hath reproved them very ſeverely.</hi> But it is eaſie to reconcile their Opinion in this Point, with that of the Chriſtians, ſince they agree, that the Books of the Bible which are called Canonical, have been equally inſpired by God; and moreover, that the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> is of the number of theſe Canonical Books.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in the Tenth Book of his Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, Chap. 12. writing of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, That he was endued with a Divine Spirit, and that he was of the number of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. He was one of the greateſt Prophets, that his Books were read by the Jews, which abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated that he converſed with God.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93753:88"/>
For he did not only foretel things to come to paſs as the other Prophets did, but he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the very time in which they were to be fulfilled. And whereas other Prophets pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted Calamities, and ſo loſt their Eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Princes and the People; He foretold Good Things to come, by which he concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the Favour of all Perſons; and as for the certainty of Events, he obtained a Belief amongſt all Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Porphiry</hi> the Philoſopher, the Scholar of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> and cotemporary with <hi>Origen,</hi> who made it his Buſineſs to refel the Propheſies of <hi>Daniel;</hi> when he found all things ſo punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally delivered, as that there was no place for a Refutation, he finally aſſumed the Impudence to affirm, that not <hi>Daniel,</hi> but an Impoſtor under his Name, who lived in the time of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes,</hi> Publiſhed theſe Prophecies.

                        <hi>It is apparent that not only the Jews, but alſo the Chriſtians were Millenaries, and did believe and expect the Temporal Reign of a Meſſiah, together with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Jews and Gentiles under one moſt happy Monarchy.</hi>

                  <p>It muſt be granted, that many eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for Sanctity, favoured the Millenaries. But if we impartially examin this matter, we ſhall find that it wholly reſts on the Authority of <hi>Papias,</hi> who pretended Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now of what Authority this Author was, I report from the Words of <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> in his 16th Exercitation, Number 74. <hi>Narrat Euſebius in tertio Hiſtoriarum, papiam hunc Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorem fuiſſe futiliſſimum, qui omnes traditionum fabellas mirifice amplecteretur, &amp; ſcriptis Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93753:90"/>
Multa igitur falſa abſurdaque de Chriſto &amp; Apoſtolis ſcripſiſſe; &amp; quaedam etiam fabulis propriora. Euſebius</hi> declares, in the third Book of his Hiſtory, that this <hi>Papias</hi> was a moſt triflng Scribler, who embraced all manner of fabulous Traditions, and committed them to Writing. He writ many falſe things of Chriſt and the Apoſtles; and ſome of his Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons look more like Dreams and Fables then true Hiſtory— And in that number <hi>Caſaubon</hi> gives a pregnant Inſtance out of <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as <hi>Papias</hi> pretended this Tradition to come from the Apoſtles, ſo he did nothing but what others in thoſe primitive times were wont to do. It was uſual for Sectaries to boaſt that they taught the Doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or at leaſt their Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>We read in <hi>Clemens Alexand. (lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Strom.</hi>) That <hi>Baſilides,</hi> an ancient Heretick, boldly avouched, that he had for his Maſter <hi>Glaucias,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Interpreter; and that <hi>Valentinus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with the like boldneſs, that he had been inſtructed in Religion by <hi>Theodad,</hi> who was one of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s familiar Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>It would be difficult to ſhow the difference in the Caſes before-mentioned; and conſequently this Tradition of <hi>Papias</hi> may be as well rejected, as that of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> or that of <hi>Valentinus;</hi> and that Tradition can be no certain Rule for us to walk by.</p>

                  <p>It is a great Boldneſs to affirm, that not one of the two firſt Centuries oppoſed this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For how could our <hi>Deiſt</hi> know this, when ſo many Monuments of Antiquity relating to the firſt Centuries are loſt? This Method I remember to be uſed by Biſhop <hi>Pearſon,</hi> in the Defence of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that in the firſt and ſecond Ages there were ſome that denied the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> to be Canonical Scripture, and that the Author thereof was <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and not St. <hi>John;</hi> and there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that induced them to think ſo, beſides this Doctrine of <hi>Milleraniſm.

By that Name
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93753:91"/>
he called the Antimillenaries; ſo that the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents of the Millenaries muſt have been then conſiderable, their Nickname is ſufficient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration thereof.</p>
                  <p>'Tis very ſurprizing to hear our Deiſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they who oppoſe this Opinion never quote any for themſelves before <hi>Dionyſius Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus:</hi> Foraſmuch as the ſame <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> in <hi>Euſebius (lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 25.) affirms that ſome who Preceeded him rejected the Book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> upon that account.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Defenders of this Doctrine kept it as ſecret as they poſſibly could. <hi>Non defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere hanc Doctrinam</hi> (ſays <hi>Lactant. lib. de vit. Beat.) publice atque aſſerere ſolemus.</hi> We are not wont to defend and aſſert this Doctrine publickly. 'Tis no wonder then if the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents of this Opinion were not ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. 'Tis alſo very plain that our <hi>Deiſt</hi> is miſtaken in the Deſign and firſt Contrivance of this Millenary Invention, as he calls it: Nay, <hi>Lactantius, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 26. pretends there is a Command from God to keep this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in ſilence. Now if <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who was himſelf a Millenary, and well acquainted with their Methods, hath rightly informed us, our <hi>Deiſt</hi>'s Suggeſtions muſt be very weak.</p>
                  <p>We read in <hi>Euſebius, (lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 23.) how ſucceſsful <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was in overthrowing Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leraniſm; and that <hi>Coracion,</hi> a principal Man of that Party, was ſo convinced by him, as that He promiſed never to diſpute for that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93753:91"/>
Doctrine more, never more to teach it, nor to make any mention of it.</p>
                  <p>If the Books of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Nepos,</hi> two of the greateſt and ableſt Writers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Parties, were now extant, we could not fail of having a true Proſpect of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; but their Books by the Injury of Times are periſhed. Upon which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we had ſaid nothing elſe, this laſt Remark had been ſufficient to defeat Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Argument drawn from the Silence of the two firſt Ages.</p>
                  <p>The various reading of the much celebrated place in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> relating to the Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, leaves us in Uncertainties: But we are confident (after a diligent Examination) that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> no where pretends (as our <hi>Deiſt</hi> bears us in hand that he did) to relate the very Words which Chriſt uſed when he delivered this Doctrine. Beſides that which is a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice never to be overcome, is the Silence of the Goſpel in ſo important a Matter.</p>
                  <p>Our Author is frequent in quoting Councils as well as Fathers for Heterodoxies: what reaſon there ſhould be for his not citing any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils in this Caſe, no not ſo much as <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, I cannot account for; I can only account for my ſelf, &amp; declare, that what general, or ancient Prov. Coun. have done in this caſe, whether they have approved it or condemned it, I do not know, neither am I aſhamed ſo to confeſs: For <hi>Scaliger</hi>

                  <p>In the beginning of the Reformation, there were ſome who endeavoured to give Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to this Opinion; wherefore our Church then paſſed a ſevere Cenſure on ſuch Perſons. For in a Convocation at <hi>London,</hi> in the Year of our Lord, 1552. in the laſt Article ſave one, the Millenaries are called Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>The Article is as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They that go about to renew the Fable of the</hi> Hereticks, <hi>called</hi> Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii, <hi>be repugnant to Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and cast themſelves headlong into a</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Dotage.</hi>

Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced by the Learned Biſhop <hi>Sparrow.</hi> I ſay Prefaced, becauſe the Author of the <hi>Antopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, (p.</hi> 56) informs us, that the ſaid Biſhop told him, <q>That he was not the Collector; and that if he had been concerned in the Collection, he would have publiſhed more Materials.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The latter part of this Information ſeems very probable; foraſmuch as the ſaid excellent Prelat was moſt accurate in Matters of this nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:93753:92"/>From what hath been ſaid concerning this Subject, we may ſufficiently diſcover Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Vanity, when, (<hi>p.</hi> 169.) he affirms that there was as Univerſal a Tradition for Milleraniſm in the Primitive Times, as for any Article of our Faith: Whereas there is no Article of our Faith but may be tried and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by that Golden Rule of <hi>Vincentius Lyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis, — Quod omnibus, quod ſemper, quod ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que;</hi> the Articles of our Faith have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all Orthodox Perſons, at all Times, and in all Places; which cannot be ſaid of Milleraniſm. We acknowledge no Articles of Faith, but ſuch only as can be proved by Holy Scriptures; and to ſuch Articles the Rule of <hi>Vincentius</hi> is only competent.</p>
                  <p>This I conceive to be the Senſe of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, in the Year of our Lord, 1562. (<hi>Collect. Artic. p.</hi> 92.) when they define that all Articles of Faith are grounded on thoſe Canonical Books of Holy Scripture; of whoſe Authority there was never any doubt in the Church. I think I may not be importune and unreaſonable, if I relate the whole Article.</p>
                  <p>Holy Scripture <hi>containeth all things neceſſary to Salvation: So that whatſoever is not Read therein, nor may be Proved thereby, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

of any Man, that it ſhould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requiſite or neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Name of the</hi> Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>we do underſtand thoſe Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Books of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, of whoſe Authority there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any doubt in the Church.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> hath given us ſome Account of the Pagan Superſtition of <hi>Augury;</hi> out of which it appears how inſufficient Natural Religion is of it ſelf, and how neceſſary Revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, to ſhew the vanity of theſe Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To this purpoſe very remarkable is that of <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro,</hi> in the end of his laſt Book <hi>Dierum genialium: Quantum debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Chriſto Domino Regi &amp; Doctori noſtro, quem verum Deum veneramur &amp; ſcimus, quo praemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrante exploſa monſtroſa ferarum gentium doctrina rituque immani ac barbaro, veram religionem edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti, humanitatem &amp; verum Deum colimus, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſque erroribus &amp; infandis ineptiis, quas priſci co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luere, quid quemque deceat &amp; quibus ſacris quaque

                  <p>Our Author is much miſtaken as to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Proceſſions. <hi>Gregory Turonenſis, lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Hiſt. cap.</hi> 37. gives us this Account: <hi>Refert</hi> Avitus <hi>in quadam homilia, quam de Rogationibus ſcripſit, has ipſas Rogationes quos ante Aſcenſionis Domini triumphum celebrantus, a</hi> Mamerto <hi>ipſius</hi> Viennenſis <hi>

                     <q>
                        <hi>Avitus</hi> reports in a certain Homily of his, which he writ of <hi>Rogations;</hi> That <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> inſtituted thoſe <hi>Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or Proceſſions, which we celebrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord's <hi>Aſoenſion.</hi>
                     </q> Out of the ſaid Homily we have this occaſion of their Iuſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; That it was appointed for diverting

                     <hi>God</hi>'s diſpleaſure, foraſmuch as in thoſe times there were great Earthquakes, Incurſions of Wolves and wild Beaſts, frequent Fires, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Sounds by night, to the extream terrrour of the People. Wherefore the ſaid Biſhop, knowing no better expedient to divert ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Chaſtiſement, than Faſting and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, ordered thoſe Days for that intent; and contrived a <hi>Litany</hi> apt and ſuitable for ſuch humble Addreſs. This pious courſe taking good effect, ſucceeding times continued it in their Anniverſary practice; ſo that the firſt Council of <hi>Orleans</hi> eſtabliſhed it by a Decree, in their 23. Canon: Which Cuſtom having had ſo long footing in the Church, our Reformers were loth to be ſingular in reſcinding of it: and the rather becauſe they obſerved that it fell caſually and beyond its firſt intention, upon ſuch a Seaſon as might be very agreeable to the Service of thoſe days. For this being the Critical time of the Year, when all the Fruits of the Earth are in greateſt hazard of miſcarrying, by Froſts and unſeaſonable Weather; it is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding proper to ſupplicate <hi>God</hi> for the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of his Judgments, and to implore his Bleſſing upon the Labours of the Husbandman. And altho' our Liturgy hath no ſet Office, yet our Church hath ſet Homilies for it. And in the <hi>Injunctions an.</hi> 1559. and <hi>Advertiſements an.</hi> 7. <hi>Elizab.</hi> it was ordered, <q>That in the <hi>Rogation</hi> Days of Proceſſion, the Curat ſing, or ſay in <hi>Engliſh</hi> the two Pſalms, beginning <hi>Benedic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma

                  </p>
                  <p>The only Authors that I have read, that can give any countenance to this Imputation of Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s, are <hi>Fromondus</hi> in his <hi>Meteors,</hi> Book 5. ch. 4. Artic. ſecond, where we are told, That in the place of the <hi>Robigalia</hi> and <hi>Floralia,</hi> the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, inſtituted the Day of <hi>Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the Supplications and Proceſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aſcenſion day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Author is Mr. <hi>Gregory,</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Ridley</hi>'s View of the Civil and Canon Law, p. 76. The old <hi>Romans</hi> inſtituted three yearly Solemnities, in the honour of their Gods, for the Fruits of the Earth: Theſe alſo the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church obſerved, having firſt moderated

their Superſtition, and directed them to a more ſacred end.</p>
                  <p>How malicious then is this Suggeſtion of Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s: His Argument is no more than this, That the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who appointed Proceſſions and Seaſons, to pray to <hi>God</hi> for his Bleſſing on the Fruits of the Earth, are guilty of <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were wont alſo to pray to their Idols for the like Bleſſing. This, I ſay, is the ſtrength of his Argument, upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Mr. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Fromondus</hi> are not miſtaken; which they certainly are, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their original Inſtitution.</p>

                  <p>How perplexed our Author is about this Queſtion! for in this Page he affirms, <q>That if the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> be a Parable (and he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it to be ſo) the <hi>Perſians</hi> may be in the right as much as the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                  <p>If the <hi>Perſians</hi> (laying aſide the Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi>) may be in the right, our Author's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Natural Religion</hi> is ridiculous: For he ſuppoſes, Page 195. the firſt Article of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

Religion</hi> to be, <hi>That there is one GOD Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, Eternal, and Creatour of all things.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Perſians</hi> make two <hi>Anti-gods,</hi> equally Infinite and Eternal, and that one of them is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Good,</hi> and the other of <hi>Evil.</hi> So that the Sentiments of the <hi>Perſians</hi> is repugnant to the Notion of a <hi>Deity:</hi> For while they make two Gods, they make none at all. And conſequently he is guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> and the great Contradictions in the Opinion of the <hi>Perſians</hi> are very palpable. If this <hi>Perſian</hi> Principle of <hi>Evil</hi> be abſolutely contrary to the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Good,</hi> it muſt in all its Perfections be contrary to it. Now ſince all Perfections belong to that Principle which is good, as Infinity of Being, and Neceſſity of Exiſtence: it unvoidably follows, That the Principle of <hi>Evil,</hi> the other <hi>Anti-god,</hi> which is in all things contrary to the former, muſt be an Infinite <hi>Non entity,</hi> which yet exiſts. And if this be not the height of <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> nothing can be ſo.

                  <p>The Opinion of the Plurality of Worlds, was maintained by ſeveral of the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, as <hi>Anaximander, Anaximenes, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, Epicurus,</hi> his Scholar, <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> and others, who maintained an infinity of Worlds: and their great Reaſon (as <hi>Elias Cretenſis</hi> ſays) was from the infinite Power and Goodneſs of God. On the contrary, the Stoics would not allow above one World, which they call the Univerſe: and <hi>Plato</hi> endeavours to prove the ſame by three Arguments, as may be ſeen in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his firſt Book, Chap. 5. of the Opinion of the Philoſophers. Of the ſame Opinion was his Scholar <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who labours to prove the ſame in no leſs then two whole Chapters; as to the Validity of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93753:103"/>
I ſhall not write any thing in particular, thinking it much better to adviſe the Reader to conſult him about this Subject. This is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that what he takes upon himſelf to prove, he commonly confirms by ſtrong Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and indeed, a Man ſhall ſcarce find any philoſophical Subject, but may, by ſome means or other, be collected out of his Writings.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> aſſures us, in his Dedication of <hi>Laertius</hi> to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, that Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> was commonly known to have ſaid, <hi>Nihil fere unquam in ipſis naturae penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus inveniſſe ſe, quin cum Ariſtotelem ſuum penſicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latius evolveret, idem ab illo aut exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>um, aut ſaltem cognitum reperiret.</hi> He ſcarce ever found any thing among the Myſteries of Nature, but when he had diligently peruſed the Books of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he found the ſame, either explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or known by him. So that I conceive, that his Authority and Reaſons to be a great Prejudice to the Opinion of the Plurality of Worlds.</p>
                  <p>'Tis reported of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that when he read the Moſaic Writings, that he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for the Majeſty of the Stile, he thought it worthy of a God. The fault he found was, that the Method was Unphiloſophical, which doth not command, but perſwades a Belief in the Reader; without all Controverſie, he committed not that pretended Error in <hi>Moſes.</hi> And therefore I doubt not, but the Reader
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93753:104"/>
will find more ſatisfaction in his Oracles of Reaſon, for the Unity of the World, then in Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s for the plurality of Worlds.</p>
                  <p>But whatſomever liberty might be allowed Philoſophers in this point, becauſe perhaps it may not plainly contradict any Principle of Reaſon, which was the Rule they walked by. The ſame ought not to be allowed to us; for this Opinion certainly deſerves a Cenſure in all, who pretend to Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The Arguments made uſe of, are very weak, the Power of <hi>God</hi> is infinite, his goodneſs is infinite and communicative, yet his Power and his Goodneſs does not extend themſelves beyond his Will and Pleaſure. This would make God a neceſſary Agent, and deprive him of thoſe Perfections he hath been pleaſed to beſtow on ſome of his Creatures. But that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all bellef is, that Mr. <hi>Blount,</hi> who makes this World we live in eternal, and conſequently uncreated, and a God, ſhould yet in this place contend for a Plurality of Worlds, and that upon a pious pretence; for fear, forſooth, that the Act of Creating ſhould only be once exerted, and for an infinite Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration lie Dormant and Uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>If this manner of Argumentation be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of, into what abſurdities may we fall? <hi>Tully,</hi> in his firſt Book, <hi>De Finibus,</hi> ſpeaking of the difference between <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> (and that <hi>Epicurus</hi> corrupts and depraves what he pretends to correct in <hi>Democritus</hi>) obſerves, that he makes innumerable Worlds
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93753:104"/>
to have their Original, and to periſh daily. <hi>Innumerabiles mundi qui &amp; oriantur &amp; interiant quotidie.</hi> How agreeable is this falſe and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Aſſertion with our Author's Method?</p>
                  <p>The minute Declination of Atomes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an efficient Cauſe is abſurd and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Philoſopher: Yet 'tis agreeable to this Method; for this Declination is more accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God's Goodneſs, then a conſtant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Deſcent of Atoms in parallel Lines. But this favour muſt not be afforded here, ſince Mr. <hi>Blount,</hi> by his approving <hi>Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> hath baniſhed, with <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> all final Cauſes from theſe Speculations.</p>
                  <p>Nay, if this Method be allowed, I know nothing in <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Natural Philoſophy but may be defended; although <hi>Tully</hi> hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved him to be as bad a Naturaliſt, as he was a Moraliſt, or a Logician.</p>
                  <p>This Opinion of the Plurality of Worlds, ſeems not to be ſo agreeable to Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Certainly <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Relation of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, muſt needs be thought to be deficient, if this Opinion be true; for he menrions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one World, which comprehended all Things. This Opinion was alſo for ſome time accounted Heretical; for <hi>Virgilius,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Zalzburg,</hi> was caſt out of his Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick, excommunicated, and condemned for a Heretick, by Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> for this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the great Annaliſt, <hi>Baronius,</hi> acquaints us, in the Year of our Lord, 748. What
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93753:105"/>
                     <hi>Aventinus</hi> and others affirm of his Deprivation and Excommunication, for holding there were Antipodes, proves a miſtake. Although I doubt not but that Aſſertion would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven great Offence; as may probably be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from <hi>Lactantius,</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>Inſtit. chap.</hi> 24. and from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> of the City of God, Book 16. Chap. 9. and from many others after them. As alſo from the little Skill that Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> and the Popes about thoſe Days, had in the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sciences.</p>
                  <p>I hope it may not be unpleaſing to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, If I give him here a ſhort account of the Reſolution of this Queſtion by <hi>Merſenus,</hi> a late learned Jeſuit, and one that had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a great Philoſopher. He thinks the Opinion of the Plurality of Worlds not to be Heretical, nor againſt the Faith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as he ſays) it doth not contradict any expreſs place of Holy Scripture, nor the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Univerſal Church. Yet he thinks it to be a very raſh Opinion, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it repugns the Conſent of the Fathers; whoſe Authority, notwithſtanding, he thinks to be of no ſuch Weight in Matters Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical.</p>
                  <p>If the Jeſuit had plainly proved this matter to be purely Philoſophical, he had not been wide of the Mark. But the Method of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Silence in ſo great a Point, makes his Reproof to be too mild, this Opinion therefore
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93753:105"/>
(to ſay the leaſt of it) is impious, prophane, and unbecoming a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>What follows in Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Oracles, touching revealed and natural Religion, hath been often treated of in the foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; in which I have proved the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of natural Religion, as to the great ends of Man's Happineſs and Miſery in another World; and other things incident to that Queſtion. Wherefore, not being willing to trouble my Reader with long Repetitions, I proceed to that which follows in this Section, and relates to <hi>Ocellus Lucanus.</hi>

                  <p>That which made <hi>Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> and others, to fall into this great Error, as to the World's Eternity, were two great Miſtakes, which they looked on as undoubted Principles. The one was, that out of nothing ſomething could not be produced; and that whatſoever had a beginning muſt have an end; and reciprocally, whatſoever ſhall have no end, had no beginning. Whereas theſe pretended Maxims are not grounded on general Reaſon,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93753:106"/>
but only upon particular Obſervations of ſuch things here below, which are produced by the ordinary ways of Generation and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet ſo difficult it is for a Man to retrieve himſelf from ſuch Obſervations, that it muſt be confeſſed, that among all the Hypotheſis of them who would deſtroy our holy Faith, none is ſo plauſible as that of the Eternity of the World.

                  <p>It is very evident, that our Naturaliſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds (in aſſerting his Principle) of the uſual Courſe of Generation and Corruption, which is obvious to our Senſes; or on the Works of Art, which always ſuppoſe pre-exiſtent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which, if we deny, all his Arguments vaniſh.

                  <p>And whereas he ſays, if we could find out that of which the World was made, yet we cannot find into what it is diſſolved, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great miſtake; for the Production of a thing hath no neceſſary Relation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance or diſcontinuance of its Exiſtence, for one thing may begin to be, and laſt but an Hour, another may laſt for a thouſand Years, another may laſt for ever; yet all three (and as many as you pleaſe) may begin at one and the ſame inſtant, the difference depending either on the Nature of the things themſelves, or on the Pleaſure and Will of God who made them.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Tranſlation of <hi>Ocellus Lucanus</hi> is not ſo fair as it ought to be; for the Greek Word, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as it is in the Original, ought to be tranſlated, <hi>Generation,</hi> and not <hi>Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which ſomewhat alters the caſe, the one being more general then the other; which yet I ſhould have taken no notice of, did it not ſeem affected and deſigned. But perhaps he followed the Tranſlation of <hi>Ludovicus No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garola,</hi> the Italian, none of the beſt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. However, this Argument of <hi>Ocellus</hi> is more groſs then the former; for he who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth the Argument this way, proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, ſave only this (which no Man in his right Wits will deny) that this Univerſe, and the Parts thereof, which are of greater Perfection, were not generated in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93753:107"/>
that we ſee ſome other Parts thereof were, as Trees, Plants, and living Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But that there can be no other way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction beſides theſe ordinary Generations, or that the Univerſe was not ſome other way actually produced, neither this Argument, nor any other of his Arguments prove. And he ſtill labours under the Imputation of that Sophiſm, of begging the Queſtion. If he had proved that, it implies a Contradiction, for Almighty God to have produced the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe after any other manner, then thoſe things are produced, which we ſee and obſerve in this World, he had proved ſomething to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>We aſſert one infinite and eternal Being, who produced all things out of nothing, and preſerves them in their Beings; and this we call not Generation, but Creation; which is a Production excluding all Concurrence of any material Cauſe, and all Dependence of any kind of Subject, as preſuppoſing no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, nor including any Motion. So that the proper and peculiar Senſe of the Word, <hi>Creation,</hi> is expreſſed, when we conceive ſomething that is made, and not any thing preceeding out of which it was made. It muſt be granted, that the Word uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> requires not ſuch a peculiar acception, for it is often uſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any kind of Production, as the making of one Subſtance out of another pre-exiſting;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93753:108"/>
as alſo, for the renovating or reſtoring any thing to its former Perfection, for want of Hebrew Words in Compoſition; nay, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imports doing ſome new and wonderful Work, the producing ſome ſtrange and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Effect. We do not therefore collect the true Nature of Creation from the Force of any Word.</p>
                  <p>(The Words, <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Annihilation,</hi> in the Modern Senſe, are not uſed, either with the Jews, the Greeks or the Latins, they are factitious Words, neither that I know of are they ſo uſed in any Tongue whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver), but we collect it from the Teſtimony of God's Word. The Opinion of the Church of the Jews, will ſufficiently appear in that zealous Mother to her ſeventh and youngeſt Son, 2d. <hi>Macchabees,</hi> Chap. 7. Ver. 28. <hi>I beſeech thee my Son, look upon the Heaven and Earth, and all that is therein, and conſider that God made them of things that are not.</hi> Which is a clear Deſcription of Creation, that is, Production out of nothing.

                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:93753:109"/>There is an excellent Treatiſe among the Works of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> entituled (<hi>Everſio dogmatum Ariſtotelis</hi>) a Refutation of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Opinions, directed to one <hi>Paul,</hi> a Presbyter of great Note, as it ſeems from the Compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation given him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. O moſt honourable Presbyter <hi>Paul.</hi> Who the Author of this Treatiſe was, is not agreed among the Criticks. He ſeems to be an Author of ſome Antiquity, for <hi>Bellarmine (De Scrip oribus Eccleſiaſticis, p.</hi> 72.) in his Book of Eccleſiaſtical Writers, gives this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Queſtion; <hi>De reprehenſione dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum Ariſtotelis meminit Photius in Bibliotheca, neque extat evidens judicium falſitatis, ideo nihil habeo quod dicam. Photius,</hi> in his Bibliothec, makes mention of the Book entituled, <hi>A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Opinions of</hi> Ariſtotle, of which there is no Proof of its being ſuppoſititious; wherefore I will determine nothing thereof. Which Author having written ſomething very material to our preſent purpoſe, I have thought fit not to paſs it over in ſilence.</p>
                  <p>The deſign of the Treatiſe, as he tells <hi>Paul</hi> the Presbyter, was to gratifie him, in writing ſome Collections and Annotations of the Opinions of the Greek Philoſophers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and his Creatures. Not, as he ſaith, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould learn any truth from them, but to make it plain to him, that the Proofs of thoſe Philoſophers were not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

on Science and Demonſtration, as they vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſted, but on uncertain Conjectures.</p>
                  <p>According to thoſe, who have received their Doctrines from God, and know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Creator and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; there is only one God unbegotten, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any Notion of that Word; who had no God, nor Gods, before him, nor any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal with him, who had no Subject on which to Operate, nor any to repugn or oppoſe his Pleaſure; having an incorruptible Nature and Eſſence, and no Impediment in his manner of operating, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>If Matter be as neceſſarily exiſtent, and as unbegotten as God himſelf; and if God out of this eternal Matter can make any thing, 'tis manifeſt that the ſame God can make ſomething out of nothing; for the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction (if there be any) will be as much in the oneas the other.</p>

                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:93753:110"/>This Obſervation is of great Value, and pulls up by the very Root, all the Hypotheſis of <hi>Ariſtotle, Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> and all other Abettors and Fautors of this wicked Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World's Eternity.</p>
                  <p>For if Matter have its Original from it ſelf, how can it be ſubject to the Power of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Whatſoever hath infinite Power in it ſelf, hath a Power upon ſomething beyond it ſelf; but if God and Matter have it both, they can never have a Power upon each other, or without themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if God's Power be infinite, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confined to Matter, for then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Bounds of infinite Power; which is a greater Abſurdity, then to aſſert a Power which is able to produce ſomething out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is commonly ſaid in the Schools, that <hi>modus operandi ſequitur modum eſſendi,</hi> ſuch as the thing is, ſuch are its Operations. And this I conceive to be an Axiom received by all Men. For if ſome real and Material Being muſt be preſuppoſed by indiſpenſable Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without which, God could not cauſe any thing to be; then God is not independent in his Actions, nor of infinite Power, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Activity; which is contradictory to the Divine Perfection.

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>The Opinion of the Chaldeans, as to the Original of the World, is laid down by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus Siculus,</hi> Book the ſecond, in theſe Words; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The Chaldeans (ſays <hi>Diodorus</hi>) affirm the World to be eternal, that it had no Beginning of its Production,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93753:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neither hereafter ſhall it have any Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the Order and Beauty of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe muſt be acknowledged to proceed from Divine Providence; and all the glorious things which we ſee in Heaven, owe not their Glory to Chance and Accident, but to the firm and unalterable Determinations of the Gods.</p>
                  <p>Of what Neceſſity Revealed Religion is, and of what Benefit to Mankind, and under what great Errors men labour who are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of it, this Inſtance of the Chaldeans ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinces.</p>
                  <p>The Reader cannot but obſerve the Art of our <hi>Deiſt,</hi> in relating the Opinion of the Chaldeans; for he hath wholly concealed what they ſay of Divine Providence, that being not for his deſign. As alſo, their great difference from his beloved <hi>Ocellus Lucanus.</hi> The Chaldeans make the World only eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as to the Matter of it, the Form they own to be from Providence; whereas <hi>Ocellus</hi> makes it eternal, not only with reſpect to its Matter, but alſo with reſpect to its Form.</p>
                  <p>What he writes as to their Computation of Four hundred and ſeventy thouſand Years before <hi>Alexander,</hi> amounts to nothing; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had proved by what kind of Years they computed, as we have done in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic Computation, which we have proved to be Solar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:93753:118"/>
                     <hi>Diodorus</hi> obſerves, that the Chaldeans, in things pertaining to their Arts, made uſe of Lunar Years of Thirty Days, which will make this monſtrous Account ſhrink conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.</p>
                  <p>The Chaldeans make ſome of their firſt Kings to Reign above Forty thouſand Years, which is ſo incredible, that <hi>Anianus</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodorus</hi> interpret thoſe Chaldean Years to be but Days.</p>
                  <p>That which will for ever cramp theſe vain Pretences of the Chaldeans, is that we have from <hi>Simplicius,</hi> on <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s ſecond Book <hi>de Coelo,</hi> where he tells us, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of <hi>Calliſthenes,</hi> that he would certifie him of the Chaldean Obſervations, which <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> did, and gives an Account not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Two thouſand Years. <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> was a grave Perſon, not to be impoſed on by the vain Brags of the Chaldeans; he would believe nothing that they could not make to appear out of good Monuments of Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>This Argument will admit of no Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Authority of one ſingle Manuſcript to the contrary, mentioned by Sir <hi>Henry Savil,</hi> in his ſecond Lecture on <hi>Eucleid,</hi> is not to be oppoſed to all the vulgar Codes.</p>
                  <p>What our Author ſays concerning <hi>Cicero</hi>'s mentioning the ſame Account of Time and Number of Years, proves nothing but this, That Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> is a Man of unparallell'd
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93753:118"/>
Boldneſs, and abuſes good Authors. 'Tis true, that <hi>Cicero</hi> mentions this monſtrous Account of the Chaldeans in two places, in his firſt and ſecond Books of Divination; but then he explodes the ſame as falſe and ridiculous. 'Tis to be noted, that Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> cites <hi>Cicero</hi> in general, and refers to no Book; he well knowing that all his Readers were not converſant in <hi>Cicero;</hi> and that if he had mentioned the place where this was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Reader would have cried ſhame on his Diſingenuity Both theſe places being to the ſame purpoſe, I will relate only that in the firſt Book, where <hi>Cicero</hi> writing of the Babylonians (who are the ſame with the Chaldeans) hath theſe Words; <hi>Condemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus hos aut ſtultitiae, aut vanitatis, aut impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae qui quadringenta &amp; ſeptuaginta millia an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum ut ipſi dicunt, monnmentis comprehenſa continent, &amp; mentiri jndicemns</hi>— We cannot but cnndemn the Chaldeans of Folly, Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Imprudence, who boaſt that they have Antiquities of 470000 Years; and in our Judgment they are guilty of Falſhood.</p>

            <p>I Have ſome reaſon to fear, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Diſcourſe may think, that I have been too brief in my Preface; wherefore I have thought fit to annex this Appendix.</p>
            <p>I have already acquainted the Reader, that I have pretermitted the Examination of ſome things in theſe <hi>ORACLES OF REASON;</hi> viz. Things purely Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical, and which may be problematically diſputed on either ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:93753:120"/>What thoſe other things are which I have pretermitted, I think it reaſonable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint my Reader with, leaſt he may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that I have paſſed over ſome Material Difficulties; I ſhall therefore give in this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix a particular Account.</p>
            <p>I have not examined, nor any ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned my ſelf, with thoſe things that are purely Political; as when our <hi>Deiſt,</hi> in the Letter directed to Sir <hi>W.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93753:120"/>
ſort of Learning, and becauſe they are without my Sphear, and propoſed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>Neither have I concerned my ſelf in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering thoſe Errors which are obvious to every Man; <hi>viz.</hi> His illogical Inferences; or his great Confidence in abuſing good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>We have an Example of the firſt (<hi>p.</hi> 196.) where, when he is to prove the Minor of his firſt Syllogiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Rule of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, ever was, or could be made known to all Men, he only proves that the large Continent of <hi>America</hi> was not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered till within theſe Two hundred Years, a Matter of Fact incontrovertible. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, unleſs he had proved that Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion never was, nor never could be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>America,</hi> he hath not proved his Minor.</p>
            <p>In like manner, when (<hi>p.</hi> 224.) he is to prove rhat there were divers othor Authors who wrote before <hi>Moſes;</hi> he thinks it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to follow an Annotator on Dr. <hi>Browne,</hi> who cites a Paſſage out of <hi>Apuleius,</hi> (whom the Pagans oppoſed to our Lord, as they did <hi>Apollonius</hi>) which proves nothing, but that there were ſome Men before <hi>Moſes:</hi> But as for Writings, we find not one Syllable in that place of <hi>Apuleius;</hi> which was the thing to be proved. As alſo, when (<hi>p.</hi> 219.) he was obliged by the Procedure of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93753:121"/>
inſiſted on, to compare the Jews with the Egyptians, Chaldees, and Phaenicians, in point of Antiquity; or to compare the Writings of thoſe reſpective Nations with each other; he changeth the Terms of the Compariſon, and compares the Nation of the Jews with the Writings of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chaldeans, and Phaenicians: This is that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> juſtly condemns in Argumentations and Compariſons, and calls it the paſſing from one Genus to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>If this Method had been uſed and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in the well known Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Scythians and the Egyptians, the Scythians would have been vanquiſhed, and the generally received Opinion of the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians Antiquity would upon no good Grounds, have been baniſhed out of the World.</p>
            <p>I have taken no notice of theſe, or of ſuch like weak Sophiſms in the foregoing Diſcourſe; becauſe they are in themſelves very Childiſh, and are eaſily to be obſerved by a conſidering Reader.</p>
            <p>I have alſo pretermitted his palpable abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing good Authors, if the Abuſe be very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; an Example of which I ſhall here produce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:93753:121"/>[Pag. 219. He thus writes; <hi>What</hi> Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus <hi>ſpeaks of the Greeks, and other Nations, may with the ſame reaſon be applied to</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Jews,</hi> viz. <hi>That all Founders and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhers of new Eſtates, have each of them ſuppoſed in their own behalf, that whoſoever was of theirs, he was the firſt of the World,</hi> Contra Apionem, <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now howover</hi> Joſephus <hi>boaſts ſo much of the Antiquity of his Country-men the Jews, yet he himſelf confeſſes, that he, nevertheleſs, durſt not preſume to compare the Nation of the Jews, with the Antiquity of the moſt Ancient and Infallible Writings of the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, Chaldeans, and Phaenicians, who dwell in ſuch Countries as are not ſubject to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Air; and are carefully provided, that whatſoever has been done by them, ſhould not ſleep in Obſcurity, but be kept in Memory, in the publick Writings of the moſt learned Men,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Apionem, lib. 1.</p>
            <p>And Pag. 220. <hi>Which is as if</hi> Joſephus <hi>had ſaid, foraſmuch as no other Nations but the Egyptians, Phaenicians, and Chaldeans, have certain Records of their Original, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I pretend my own Nation of the Jews to be ancienter then them, who cannot diſprove me; but becauſe the Egyptians,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93753:122"/>
Phaenicians, and Chaldees, have more ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of their Country in being; therefor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being confuted, I think it more convenient to yeild to them in Antiquity. And this is the Secret meaning of what</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſays</hi>].</p>
            <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Blount.</hi>

               <p>He that will but take ſome pains to read over the two Books, which <hi>Joſephus</hi> wrote for the ſake of his <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and for ſuch as he was, lovers of Truth, in oppoſition to <hi>Apion</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> will ſoon perceive the perverſeneſs of our Author, to exceed that of this malapert, and petulant Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian.</p>
               <p>The deſign of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in theſe two Books was to ſhow, that <hi>Apion</hi>'s Negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the ſilence of the Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors (with reſpect to the Jews) was of no moment; foraſmuch as the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, and Phaenecians, who had anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter and more ſure Hiſtories; and had better ways and means of Writing, then the Greeks make mention of his Country-men the Jews: And this in effect, is the Sum of all that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93753:122"/>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes on this Matter, in his Books againſt <hi>Apion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſeems to make an Apology for the bragging <hi>Greeks</hi> in point of Antiquity, when He ſays, that all their Greek Writers ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in their own behalf, that whoſoever was of theirs, was the firſt of the World; but <hi>Joſephus</hi> alſo adds (what our <hi>Deiſt</hi> omits, and alters the caſe) that this was for want of letters; the ancient uſe of which came to the Greeks from the Phaenicians and <hi>Cadmus;</hi> and that at that time the Greeks had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Records: That <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Poem</hi> was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt Book which they had, and this was written after the Trojan War: Nay, that this Poem was not at firſt written, but was preſerved by Tradition, and the People's Songs. And that this was the cauſe of that great Diſſonancy and Difference which appeared in Original Copies, when it was firſt committed to Writing. It was for want of Letrers they had no ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and that their <hi>Cadmus Mileſius,</hi> and their <hi>Acuſilaus Argivus,</hi> did not long preceed the Expedition of the Perſians againſt the Greeks.</p>
               <p>Whereas nothing is, nor can be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to him that reads <hi>Joſephus,</hi> than this, that the ſame Prejudice doth not affect
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93753:123"/>
                  <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore our Author hath with great Incogitancy affirmed, that what <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſpeaks of the Greeks, and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may with the ſame reaſon be applied to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Jews.</p>
               <p>Our Author by this Aſſertion, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws his own Suppoſition; for if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were the firſt Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the World, according to <hi>Moſes;</hi> or at leaſt muſt be ſuppoſed to be ſuch, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Author's Method in this place; then there could not be two Creations, one in the firſt, and another in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> there could be no Praeadamites, as is pretended; and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were created in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> Which yet Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> can by no means allow of, without being repugnant to himſelf, and contrary to his own Method in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> no where affirms, that the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Phenicians,</hi> had more ancient Records than the <hi>Jews:</hi> He no where affirms, That he dares not compare the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſo it ought to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and not the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as I obſerved in another place) with the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and infallible Writings (I uſe our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's words) of the foreſaid Nations. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:93753:123"/>
indeed ſays, He will not enumerate the <hi>Jews</hi> with thoſe Barbarous Nations, with reſpect to the advantages of writing Hiſtory; but then he determines the advantage on the behalf of the <hi>Jews:</hi> For in that Book he plainly aſſerts, That <hi>Moſes</hi> was the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of all <hi>Legiſlators;</hi> and that the <hi>Jews</hi> had a more certain way of tranſmitting their Memoirs to Poſterity, than the <hi>Egyptians Chaldeans,</hi> or <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Moſes</hi> was a more ancient Hiſtorian than <hi>Beroſus</hi> the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> or <hi>Manetho</hi> the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> or <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> the <hi>Phenician,</hi> is an unqueſtioned Truth, among all ſuch as know any thing of theſe matters: nothing being more evident than this, That <hi>Beroſus</hi> and <hi>Manetho</hi> lived after the time of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great; and that <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> wrote after the <hi>Trojan</hi> War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> no where affirms, That the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the forenamed Hiſtorians are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; he only prefers them before the <hi>Greeks</hi> in point of Verity and Antiquity: as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, he allows it to no Hiſtorian but <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom alone he makes to be divinely inſpired. As to the point of Antiquity, we appeal to our Author himſelf, who (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what he hath here written of this matter) page 224. confeſſes, <hi>That we have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93753:124"/>
no Writer extant at this time more ancient than</hi> Moſes, <hi>unleſs it be</hi> Ocellus.—His exception of <hi>Ocellus</hi> is of no moment, as we have proved in the foregoing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>After all my Search, I can no where find <hi>Joſephus</hi> abſolutely affirming, That the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Phenicians</hi> had any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Records of their Original; but only Comparatively with the <hi>Greeks:</hi> He no where affirms, directly, or indirectly, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Nation, had more ancient Records of their Country to refute him; and that therefore he thinks more convenient, to yield to them in Antiquity: and therefore our <hi>Deiſt</hi> is forc'd to uſe this <hi>Device,—This is the ſecret meaning of what</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays is clear and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous: there is no colour for ſo ſlanderous an Inſinuation; and I think I may affirm witout any Calumny, or Controverſy, That not <hi>Joſephus,</hi> but our <hi>Deiſt</hi> had a <hi>Secret mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to impoſe on credulous <hi>Readers,</hi> by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing good Authors.</p>
               <p>We may bid Farewell to all Evidence in Matters of Fact, if <hi>Secret meanings</hi> be allow'd of: but perhaps our <hi>Deiſt</hi> had herein a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Himſelf; hoping that at a dead lift, <hi>This Secret meaning</hi> might gloſs, and varniſh over ſome of his monſtrous, and incredible
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93753:124"/>
Tenents. I am ſure that by this <hi>Hocus-pocus</hi> Trick, he might have cited <hi>The Hind and Panther</hi> (which he quotes pag. 150.) for the Antiquities of his <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians, Phenicians;</hi> and have quoted <hi>Joſephus</hi> for the <hi>Frauds and Impoſings of the Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I am making towards a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I hope I may do a thing grateful to the <hi>Reader,</hi> and be not thought to deviate from my Subject, if I here preſent him with the great Averſion that our Church hath for <hi>Deiſm.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of</hi> England (<hi>Article</hi> 18.) <hi>declares in theſe words,</hi> 
                  <q>They are alſo to be had accurſed, that preſume to ſay, that every Man ſhall be ſaved by the Law or Sect which he profeſſeth, ſo that he be diligent to frame his Life according to that Law, and the Light of Nature; for Holy Scripture doth ſet out unto us, only in the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whereby Men must be ſaved.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:93753:125"/>This Article plainly declares (as Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> on the Articles, p. 87. collects) that the Profeſſion of every Religion cannot ſave a Man, live he never ſo vertuouſly. It alſo follows from this Article, That no Man ever was, or ſhall be ſaved, but only by the Faith and Name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Opinion of the <hi>Deiſt</hi> is diametrically oppoſite hereunto: For (pag. 199. and 200.) he affirms, That Natural and Unrevealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is ſufficient to make us happy in a future State. And he affirms (p. 201.) That this his Opinion is Charitable; foraſmuch as it doth not exclude any Diſſenters from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs; and that <hi>God</hi> may be pleaſed with different Worſhips.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Book of <hi>Hereſies (cap.</hi> 72.) reckons that of the <hi>Rhetorians</hi> to be one: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they believe, that all hereticks hold the Truth, and walk uprightly. Which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls a Hereſy of wonderful vanity, and ſuch as ſeems to him incredible: my own part I cannot perceive any great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>Rhetorians</hi> and the <hi>Deiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas our <hi>Deiſt</hi> ſeems to value his Opinion upon the pretended Charitableneſs thereof, and thinks that a Recommendation:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93753:125"/>
He is much miſtaken; for this Opinion is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Turkiſh</hi> than Charitable.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Busbequius (Epiſt.</hi> 3.) that <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> the Prime <hi>Vizier,</hi> perſwaded that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Embaſſadour to turn <hi>Muſſelman;</hi> and that if he would do ſo, he ſhould receive great Honours and Rewards, from <hi>Solyman</hi> his Lord and Emperour: To whom <hi>Busbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi> makes this Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mihi certum eſt manere in ea Religione, in qua natus eſſem quamque Dominus meus profite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Pulchre, inquit</hi> Ruſtanus, <hi>ſed tamen de anima quid fiet? Et de Anima, inquam, bene ſpero. Tum ille cum pauliſper intercogitaſſet, ita eſt profecto: neque ego ab hac abſum ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, aternae beatitudinis conſortes fore, qui ſancte innocenterque hanc vitam traduxerint quamcunque illi Religionem ſecuti ſunt.</hi> — <q>I am reſolved, ſays <hi>Busbequius,</hi> to continue in that <hi>Religion</hi> in which I were born, and which my Lord profeſſes: Very well, ſays <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> but what will become of your Soul in another World? I am, ſays <hi>Busbequius,</hi> very confident of its welfare. Then <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> after ſome pauſe, makes this Anſwer, I am of your Mind; this is my Opinion, <hi>That all Perſons ſhall be eternally happy, that lead an innocent life,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93753:126"/>
notwithſtanding their differences in</hi> Religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Prime <hi>Vizier</hi>'s Opinion ſeems to me to be the ſame with Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>'s; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo charitable: And if our <hi>Deiſt</hi> had been preſent at that Interview, 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent enough with whom he would have ſided: And if the ſame Offers had been made to him (which were made to that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Embaſſadour, 'tis plain enough what he would have done. So that if I ſhould aſſert, <hi>That</hi> Deiſm <hi>is a direct Road to</hi> Turciſm, <hi>I think I ſhould not be miſtaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Deiſt</hi> muſt have more Confidence, and (all things conſidered) better luck than <hi>Polus</hi> had in <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Exorciſms, if he can perſwade any Perſons who ſeriouſly conſult their own Salvation, <hi>To behold any Happineſs in his Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's worth our obſervation, in what dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and abhorrence our <hi>Church of England</hi> hath the Opinion of the <hi>Deiſts;</hi> for it affixes an <hi>Accurſe to it:</hi> which I think is not very uſual for Provincial Councils.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> indeed, in his Appendix to the <hi>Nullity of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Faith</hi> (pag. 240.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

theſe words: — <q>If we look into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Councils, we ſhall find, That this Practice of <hi>Anathematizing</hi> was not only in uſe in general, but alſo in particular, and Provincial Councils.</q> I doubt not but this Learned Man had good grounds for his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion: Yet I muſt confeſs for my own part, I have not obſerved this Method in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Councils; if we except that Orthodox Council held at <hi>Gangra,</hi> in <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> about the Year of our Lord 324. in every one of whoſe Canons, about twenty in number, we find an <hi>Accurſe</hi> affix'd: a ſufficient Inſtance <hi>In Antiquity to juſtify our</hi> Church<hi>'s Method.</hi>
